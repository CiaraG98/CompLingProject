This week's show is reported by a friend of mine, Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr. \
Last spring, he gave me a call. He wanted to talk about a show idea. His big pitch-- a podcast series about activists. \
I was not into it. I had covered protests in Ferguson the year Michael Brown was shot. Spent late nights watching protesters \
standoff with police, weekends at marches. I know how this goes. It's always the same story-- chanting, impassioned \
activists talking about why they came out, hopeful, forward-looking statements. I watched as the story replicated \
in cities across the country with Black death after Black death. Saidu and I talked for an hour. I wasn't sold. \
He ignored me and made the show anyway. It's a podcast called Resistance. And I cannot bear how happy me saying \
the next few words will make Saidu, but it's good. So he didn't make the story you'd get by going to protest after protest, \
like I feared. Instead, he told stories that unfold over time, about people's lives being changed by the decision to protest, \
what happens with their personal relationships, home life taking a backseat, exhaustion, egos, celebration, and arguments. \
Saidu made the story that's always been there, but no one ever tells. There's this perception of Black Lives Matter, that it's \
this one thing. But of course, the larger social movement of our time is really a loose collection of different groups with \
different personalities, goals, and methods. And Saidu made a series of stories about one of them, a group called Warriors in \
the Garden. It was started by about a dozen activists, mostly in their 20s, Black and Brown-- a handful of women, but mostly men. \
They're students, marketing directors, waiters, and models. Derrick Ingram, one of the founding members of the group, says a thing \
that unifies them is that each one of them is the loudest person they know."

text2 = "Think about this. Like, I saw 5,000 people marching and I thought, I can lead them. I need to get in front. How narcissistic do you have to be to jump in front of 5,000 people and just start screaming at them? Like, I mean-- but I did it."

text3 = "All the Warriors in the Garden did it. And they found each other because they were all at the front of the marches. And very quickly, they became one of the best known groups in New York City organizing protests after the murder of George Floyd.\
The group is cool. They look cool. And they built a huge social media following. When people showed up to their protests, they made sure they had a good time, which meant a lot of chanting and dancing and music being played. They were explicitly a nonviolent \
organization because they didn't want their events to feel like endless clashes with police. They wanted them to feel like celebrations."

text4 = "Our actual marches are like club promoting. Like, we have digital campaigns. And a lot of groups don't roll like that. They make these half-assed flyers on Canva. They don't even know what their route's going to be. \
People are high out of their minds, screaming, tagging shit. That's not how Warriors roll. Yeah, there's a level of professionalism, joy. Not to bastardize or commercialize what we do, but people have called us the Summer Jam or Coachella of protests."

text5 = "That's Saidu laughing. And on today's show, we're going to bring you some of what he found. He got very interested in three of the Warriors in particular, three people Saidu really identified with-- men who entered the movement with similar ideas \
and motivations, who changed over the course of 10 months and ended up in very different places with different conclusions. But the story is not just about them. It's also about Saidu. Here he is."
