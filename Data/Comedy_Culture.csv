1,Comedy Week,2,That’s when we will be at peak week peak comedy like all the seers and the Internet fretted about send your charts about today the subject is podcast comedy podcast.
1,Comedy Week,1,What is comedy. Comedy is the interruption of expectation in a humorous way. What is a podcast. Well this 2013 YouTube video by Colin grey explains podcast refers to a series of audio files. Where as a podcast episode as one episode of that podcast.
1,Comedy Week,3,So one audio file would be a podcast episode. That’s when you just can’t absolute one and say you’re going to talk about one topic. And that one. One episode of your podcast. Whereas when you talk about a podcast that is actually a C.D. for example a TV series you talk about EastEnders or friends laughs a C.D. TV series and a podcast. Is similar in that it’s a series of episodes.
1,Comedy Week,1,A podcast is a series. Personally I subscribe to quite a few podcasts cities let me list them all for you. Adam Carolla Ted Alexandra Adam Ferrara Baby Geniuses Burt cast Bullseye with Jesse Thorn Chapo trap house kind of comedic. Chris gathered presents come to Poppa with Tom Poppa. Conor needs a friend. The Daily Show everything is a life from live from the Comedy Cellar dead pilot society. Gilbert Gottfried getting better with Ron functions hello from the magic Tavern. Jamie and Jackie and Laurie J.V. club. Larry Wilmore less culture risk does mobile juries. Seth Meyers late night legion of skanks Mike on much Dave Smith’s part of the problem and he is punch up the jam are you talking to me Real Time with Bill Marr reality blows Ron Burgundy bitch sesh seven second delay Too Beautiful to Live W T F Sklar brothers cheap seats. Who cares about the Rock Hall and remaining acts which is more about Brexit than it is funny. But is the funniest Brexit podcast out there. Now you might ask. Do I listen to these all. Yeah I listen to them all not every episode but I check in on every episode. How long does it take me takes me as long as one episode of The Joe Rogan show so today for Comedy Week we decided to do this to play each and every podcast that I listen to all at the same time. And here now is a sample of that.
1,Comedy Week,2,K being told that it’s not gonna work. Let’s do this instead Let’s pick to run. This is a great standup who has been doing his podcast getting better for a little while now. So I wanted to talk about a new podcast or who’s also an established comic about how it’s going for him. But I wanted to pair him with a veteran of the game who’s better than Jesse Thorn who hosts bullseye and Jordan Jesse go and he’s the founder and chief of the maximum fun network. I wanted to know how comedy is affecting podcasts but also how podcasts are affecting Brexit and they had no good answers on that so I asked them well OK how are our podcasts affecting comedy. Which was arguably more relevant to the topic at hand. Enjoy as Comedy Week marches on comedy and podcasting a match made in studios.
1,Comedy Week,4,I would say the very first podcast if memory serves and a lot of crime dramas shows that it doesn’t but the very first podcast as a podcast that I ever listened to was something called The Sound of Young America and a guy named Jesse Thorne who was maybe a college student then went up in a biplane. Don’t ask me how I got wise to The Sound of Young America but Jesse Thorne has become a friend of mine. He created the the podcasting company called maximum fun and he’s responsible and I guess is the executive producer of such comedy podcasts as the adventure zone and BBC geniuses Dave Hill’s podcasting incident the flophouse which I love the Jackie and Laurie show Judge John Hodgman.
1,Comedy Week,1,Jordan Jesse go. PAULA POUNDSTONE my brother my brother and me. So that is the first comedy podcast I ever listened to the latest comedy podcast I have subscribed to is getting better with Ron funk as Ron is a headlining comedian everywhere who has an amazing life story. So the podcasts about third affirmations and third conversations with another great comedian Ron and Jesse are here to talk about comedy podcasting in general.
1,Comedy Week,5,Hey Mike shout out to the Red Baron pizza squadron he took me up in that biplane. Yeah. Who knew it would still be paying off with plugs on podcasts all these years later.
1,Comedy Week,1,The pizza squadron. I didn’t I did not know that that was a day I knew about the you know two seventy seventh Lancers about this pizza squash chef there.
1,Comedy Week,5,Well that’s what happens when you retire from the Blue Angels. They put you in the pizza squadron. Yeah.
1,Comedy Week,1,If the Blue Angels can’t protect the homeland. Only the pizza squadron can. So Ron what’s your pizza squadron now. Ron what podcast Did you listen to.
1,Comedy Week,6,If any that inspired you to do a podcast I would say the one that inspired me. I kind of actually listened to Jackie and Laurie. That’s one of my few comedy related podcasts. I listen to a lot of pro-wrestling podcast.
1,Comedy Week,7,That’s kind of what inspired me to do it actually is that I noticed a couple of friends of mine a gentleman and Conrad Thompson and he was working with some some older wrestlers and they had this podcast and it was starting to really take off and then I started noticing that they were doing some of the same venues that I was doing in a live show and that they were selling them out and I was like Oh. And it mostly as well just came from a place of necessity with me where I was I felt like I was doing a lot of guesting on a lot of other people’s shows I was doing a lot of helping other people by being you know funny on their products but I didn’t have my own home. I didn’t have my own place for people to come and see what I was about in a long form. And so that’s pretty much. Those two things were the inspiration for me starting my podcast.
1,Comedy Week,1,What do you get from it. What needs does it feel that your other outlets like acting writing on shows and especially standup where you could be really expressive so what needs does it feel for you as the creator of the content.
1,Comedy Week,7,It gives me other avenues basically and gives me the things that talk about where even in stand up there is like kind of this pressure not necessary pressure but it’s my job to entertain above all like I can get up there and talk about everything I want to talk about but I have to make it entertaining and podcasts. I don’t necessarily have to do that. I could just talk and not have a punch line ready.
1,Comedy Week,6,I can just go into different subjects and they kind of feed each other because some subjects that I bring up on the podcast end up making it into my act. And it’s just.
1,Comedy Week,7,And also it just gives me more. You know as sure as you guys evolve found out from doing the podcast people learn more and more about you and those are the people who become the most invested in me and the ones they were coming out to my shows and the ones that they actually get get something from it. And it makes me it’s a different feeling from when people go oh we think you’re funny in this show or we are. We thought that was a great set or when someone comes up to mingle Hey I listen to you talk about how you were doing OK but you weren’t feeling that great and you got into therapy and it made me feel OK about going to therapy and it got me enrolled in therapy and now I’m doing better.
1,Comedy Week,8,And like that is like oh I’m hoping something I’m helped I’m actually being a positive force and that to me that’s like way bigger than like a joke in the year that you’ve been doing at 56 episodes in an episode.
1,Comedy Week,8,It’s not like a giant difference at all. It’s just I can tell when I go on a road and sometimes I bring little merch with me and people will buy things tour related but my biggest selling item is my podcast shirt. And so it just lets me know like right away or like Oh OK. And just when I’m getting introduced and people are bringing up my credit and when my podcast starts getting bigger reactions then the shows I’ve been on is like OK this is starting to build a little bit of steam and still very small. It’s not you know the biggest pay cuts at all but it’s what I think. Like just want my comedy The people who find it and enjoy it really get something from it and it makes me makes me happy.
1,Comedy Week,9,It’s a really different kind of relationship right. Like I mean it’s somebody who’s like I’ve done a few stand hosted a few standup shows for people who didn’t know who I was and it’s it can be fine. Like if you have the material you can make them laugh it’s great. They came out to see somebody who was going to make them laugh but there’s a big difference between that and the experience of building a real connection with somebody.
1,Comedy Week,8,Oh absolutely. There’s a big difference between me going out and doing a joke about my girlfriend and people just laughing or someone goes yells out robot and then I’m like Oh OK.
1,Comedy Week,7,Like you know you know what I’m talking about it now you also gives me kind of a excuse to be able to go a little bit deeper and more into the words a thing and sometimes that helps me find jokes that I otherwise wouldn’t have found because I didn’t feel comfortable to shit with sharing that you know empowering helpful hecklers.
1,Comedy Week,1,But tell me about that. You really you think you’ve written jokes or gotten material that comes directly or indirectly from doing the podcast.
1,Comedy Week,6,Yes definitely. Because the biggest response I’ve gotten from the podcast what I’ve knows from other comedians who are like hey I don’t I don’t listen because I don’t listen to your pocket.
1,Comedy Week,7,I know what your bike has. But I do look at the clips of your affirmations and they make me feel good. And hearing that from like not just fans but also my peers made me go like oh maybe this is something I need to bring in to my regular act as well and so it’s kind of started where I start my show by asking people like hey I hope you guys are feeling great we’ll be feeling strong. Hope you feeling happy. Are you happy and in the reaction that gives to asking a group of people to look at themselves and ask themselves if they’re happy. It creates like laughter They’re like some people realize they are. Some people realize they aren’t. And then it is fun to talk about and it kind of opens my set that way. And it’s something I wouldn’t have really felt comfortable doing if I hadn’t started with the affirmations.
1,Comedy Week,1,So just give me a little bit. I know the pizza by plane incident. When did the when did the Comedy Network start and what were the ideas about what you could do in the beginning and then we’ll talk about how that’s all changed.
1,Comedy Week,10,I mean I started podcasting in 2004 and The Sound of Young America like that that pizza baron thing happened because they called my college radio station and I happened to answer and I was like yes I will go in your biplane but I started podcasting in 2004.
1,Comedy Week,10,True. Mostly it’s just complaints about how we don’t ever talk about how 9/11 was an inside job. But anyway I started podcasting into like the very dawn of podcasting basically and not because I was that guy but just because I was making this show and I thought well if I could get a couple hundred people to listen to it this way it’s worth it. And I moved to L.A. in 2000 and eight something like that. And when I moved to L.A. I gave up my job in San Francisco I had been working as a receptionist at a nonprofit and I was like I will just not get a job I will just figure out how to make money from this. And the podcast network was born of that and the model was for for us for maximum fun and still is really a lot like a public radio station or a public television station which is to say people voluntarily give us money. Now we’re for profit but you know people give us five bucks a month to support our shows and that’s where the bulk of our revenue comes from.
1,Comedy Week,10,And it was you know for years and I did that basically because there were there was no one willing to advertise on a podcast at the time. So I did that you know and it was many years of making fourteen thousand dollars in a year which was like just enough to cover my rent and food and catastrophic health insurance. And then you know built it up over time and each time podcasting has been invented from you know Ricky Gervais is inventing podcasting to Marc Maron inventing podcasting to serial inventing podcasting to recently Conan O’Brien inventing podcasting and all the other people who invented podcasting along the way each time that kind of the rising tide lifts all the boats including ours to the point where now as as my old producer used to say you finally don’t have to explain what podcasting is to your dentist.
1,Comedy Week,1,Yeah although you you may you made this reference to Marc Maron inventing podcasting but didn’t you in fact invent Marc Maron and also as far as serial goes frame. ADNAN SYED Yeah you did.
1,Comedy Week,5,Yes I will Marc was Marc started his show after he got fired from Air America for like the fourth time and he and his producer were recording it by sneaking into Air America late at night because they never turned off their pass keys. And I think you know by the time you’re fired four times just people are used to seeing you there whether you’re employed currently employed by them or not.
1,Comedy Week,10,In fact I had once recorded an interview with Marc Jordan my co-host then Jordan and I had recorded an interview with Marc where we were standing at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus in our underpants broadcasting live for a pledge drive. But Mark emailed me. He’s like You know you like podcasting right. And I was like Yeah. And he’s like How do you how do podcast.
1,Comedy Week,5,Brendan lives in New York. And so he just had a grumble on an e-mail. Yes. So I went over and like helped him set up his microphones but it was truly like he’s been very kind about giving me credit. It was truly like two hours of helping him or three hours of helping him because I you know I liked and admired him so much. I did not expect at the time that his show would be so much better and more successful than mine.
1,Comedy Week,9,I would say that you know there’s a few shows that there was a few shows that are still extant that were popular in the early days. Jimmy Pardo and Matt Belknap were Jimmy being Jimmy is a wonderful Los Angeles standup one of the funniest guys in L.A..
1,Comedy Week,10,And Matt was the boss of this comedy nerd community called a special thing AECOM that started as a tenacious d tribute Web site but eventually grew into being this place where L.A. alternative comics would hang out and talk with each other about comedy in L.A. Matt and Jimmy Pardo started never not funny in two thousand six or something like that. And I think that was very hugely influential for the Los Angeles comedy scene. And Jimmy was very close and is very close with Scott Herman who started comedy death ray which became comedy bang bang which is you know sort of brought the L.A. alternative comedy scene that was around the live shows that he’d been producing in the world of Mr. Show in the world of the UCB Theater here in L.A. into it into podcasting and then there are also you know there are folks like the guys from a yard dude which is a comedy podcast that’s been running since the very beginning days of podcasting. That’s still running and still very successful. But like in the in the comedy community in L.A. which was on top of podcasting seven years or five years before even New York or or anywhere else in the country I think a lot of credit has to go to Jimmy Pardo and Matt Belknap and also to Scott Ackerman whose show who shows format brought a lot of people in doing characters and doing better but also doing interviews with standups and so on and so forth.
1,Comedy Week,1,But the the Pardo Show and The Comedy Bang Bang those are committing comedy those are performing comedy two different kinds of comedy yeah. Whereas the WEF show is examining comedy and it seems to me I don’t know if it’s a 50 50 split but unlike comedy on television when you say comedy it’s you expect to tune in and be entertained and laugh a huge percentage of comedy podcasts like Ron’s is the discussion of comedy.
1,Comedy Week,5,Well I think that’s because Ron maybe you can speak to this but I feel like a lot of comics that I know are like Well for one thing if they’re going to have guests on their show it’s going to be comics because that’s the only people they relate to socially like the only people that they talk to you on a daily basis or other people at the back of the bar.
1,Comedy Week,11,But also I think there’s a lot of comics who felt the way that I felt when I started The Sound of Young America when I was in college which is you know in till this wave of comedy podcasting and a sort of attendant wave of comedy geek re comedy nursery being serious about comedy like really caring about comedy either as a consumer or as a producer was a really fringy thing. There was no media there was no mass media about comedy and really like you know there’s that scene in Freaks and Geeks where Martin Starr’s character goes into his house he’s a latchkey kid and he sits down on the couch and he’s like eating a peanut butter sandwich by himself and laughing at Garry Shandling hosting them tonight Charlie’s in the background.
1,Comedy Week,12,Oh absolutely most definitely. I had a lot of kind of thing. I had Emily Gordon on and we talked about how this was the one of the only times we were able to actually sit and have a conversation because everybody’s so busy that you have to actually sit and book them for an hour to sit and talk to have these conversations. But I would say the most recent examples I just recorded an episode with Esther privacy and I’d seen her around doing stand up a bunch. I watched her on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I’d seen bits of her show but and I just always thought she was funny you I thought she was nice and to this our conversation we just kind of learned so much about each other where we’re like oh we have so much more in common than we ever knew we both. I didn’t know that we were both from Illinois.
1,Comedy Week,12,That I love about color is one of the nicest things you ever told to me when the first time that they did shows like he was like I like you. He’s like can I support you because I tell you I can tell you just love comedy for comedy sake you’re not in love of comedy for what it can get you. And that’s what the conversation I had with Esther by the end of that I was like Oh I love you because I can tell how much you truly love this art form. And I wouldn’t have known that if I hadn’t had that conversation with her.
1,Comedy Week,9,I mean Mike is somebody who who’s interviewed all kinds of creative people for 20 years now on Bullseye which is my NPR show. I think that one of the special things about people in comedy that’s different from musicians or writers or whatever is that this this form of podcasting comes almost natively to them because comics and I’m including you know improv comics sketch comics in this as well are used to the idea of figuring out the world by talking it through and figuring out the world by talking with people that they like and admire. So there’s this value which is as Ron said being entertaining right. Like you have to be able to deliver a laugh to be respected in the comedy community.
1,Comedy Week,12,I don’t look at their audiences as people who were looking for a podcast and then found something and like this is what those were Conan fans. Those were Joe Rogan fans and they heard they had pork as they didn’t know what a podcast even meant. But they knew they like Cone. They knew they liked Joe Rogan but now they’re in the ecosystem now they press that podcast button and so they’re gonna need at some point everyone you know I have my favorite shows I can watch Seinfeld I can watch I Love Lucy and king of the hill every day until I die probably.
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",13,"I really appreciate you making the time. I thought we would start with the beginning of Is This Anything? And in the, I suppose you could call it the introduction or the preface, another book pops up, which is The Last Laugh by Phil Berger, and I would love to just know how that book entered your life?"
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"How did I find that? I really don’t know. But I still have it. I have the copy that I bought wherever I found it. I mean, I was in high school and I did the absolute minimum you could do to survive in high school. I never read anything outside of high school except magazines, car magazines, comic books, and Esquire because I don’t know, in those years, early ’70s, Esquire was really full of character, and about encouraging male boldness and inventiveness in lifestyle and just life in general. They were very sophisticated and it was everything I wanted to be."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"I wanted to be urban and I wanted to be smart, and smarter than I was. I wanted to have this cool, adventurous life. And they were very encouraging to that. I don’t think there’s anything like that around today, but that was essential. The same with that book, The Last Laugh, it was just like, whatever made men in centuries past become explorers. I don’t know how they became that. I guess I remember reading about explorers clubs, in 17th, 18th century London. I have two sons and a daughter and that’s the thing I really wanted. If I could pass along — the two things I would want to pass along would be ethics and boldness in life. But that doesn’t answer your question of where I got the book. I don’t know where I got it."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"It’s okay, though. The genesis story is secondary. It’s really the context that you’re providing. And just as a quick side-note, a friend of mine, Cal Fussman, used to write the What I’ve Learned interview series in Esquire —"
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",13,"back when it had that, and maybe still does on some level, that character that you’re describing, that boldness. What was it inside The Last Laugh that grabbed you so much?"
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"So if I look back at my whole life starting about second or third grade, it was all this inexorable march towards this pursuit of the comedy arts. There was nothing else about comedy. Albert Brooks did an album or did an article in Esquire called School For Comedians, and it was a parody — and I had no idea it was a parody. He grew up in L.A. and he was making fun of what comedians might need to learn to be comedians. And it was an early ’70s Esquire article. I had no idea it was a parody. I mean, I was just, “Oh, there’s a school?” I just wanted to learn about this world. The Last Laugh really took you deeply into the world. It is a completely hermetically sealed world that is frankly, unrelated to the rest of the entertainment industry. It’s really unrelated to almost all other creative arts. It is a very sealed ecosystem, the world of comedy, particularly stand-up comedy. I was desperately thirsty for any scrap of data about it."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",13,"Now you have, much like an Olympic athlete of sorts, with training logs and workouts and so on, you have 45 years of “hacking away,” as it’s put in the book’s description, on yellow notepads. So you’ve preserved all of this. I’d love to speak or to hear you speak, more accurately, a bit about your writing process? And in the preparation that I did for this, I read in The New York Times, and I’m just going to read this short bit."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",13,"You can fact correct this, if need be, but here’s how it reads. “I still have a writing session every day. It’s another thing that organizes your mind. The coffee goes here. The pad goes here. The notes go here. My writing technique is just: You can’t do anything else. You don’t have to write, but you can’t do anything else.” I would love to hear you elaborate on that, because it actually sounds very similar to what the fiction writer Neil Gaiman has as his first rule of writing as well."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",13,"Yeah. But what does that look like for you? What do your writing sessions tend to look like if we look back over the last, I don’t know, 10 years, because I’m sure it’s changed over time?"
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"The only thing that’s changed is the coffee, which I didn’t know about coffee in my younger years. I think I discovered coffee after I had kids, and I didn’t have time to have long meals with my friends anymore. But we could meet for coffee. Then I realized, “Boy, this coffee really gets you talking.” And I thought, “Maybe I’ll do a show where you just talk with coffee.” And that’s where that came from, the Comedians in Cars show."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"But my writing sessions used to be very arduous, very painful, like pushing against the wind in soft, muddy ground with a wheelbarrow full of bricks. And I did it. I had to do it because there’s just, as I mentioned in the book, you either learn to do that or you will die in the ecosystem. I learned that really fast and really young, and that saved my life and made my career, that I grasped the essential principle of survival in comedy really young. That principle is: you learn to be a writer. It’s really the profession of writing, that’s what standup comedy is. However you do it, anybody, you can do it any way you want, but if you don’t learn to do it in some form, you will not survive."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",13,"When you sit down, is it an empty page? Is it bits and pieces that you’ve noted through the week as observations that you then flesh out? What is actually in front of you when you start?"
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"What’s in front of me is I’m usually about 15 or 20 pages of stuff that’s in various states of development. And then there’s a smaller book of just really, really random things. Like, when you’re on a cell phone call and the call drops, and then you reconnect with the person, they’ll go, “I don’t know what happened there.” As if anyone is expecting them to know anything about the incredibly complex technology of the cell phone, they offer this little, I don’t know if it’s an excuse or an apology. They go, “I don’t know what happened there.” So anyway, so I don’t know. So that’s an example of something in that, my little tiny notebook, that I don’t know what to do with that. But it’s just so stupid to me and funny."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"So that to me is like an archery target, 50 yards away. Then I take out my bow and my arrow and I go, “Let me see if I can hit that. Let me see if I can create something that I could say to a room full of humans in a nightclub, that will make them see what I see in that.” There’s something stupid and funny about that to me. That’s the very, very beginning. So then I’ll write something about it. It’ll be, if I’m lucky, it’ll be a half a page or a page on a yellow legal pad and I’ll write that. Then in the session the next day, if I get around to it, I will see it again and I will see what I have and what I like and I don’t like. And as any writer can tell you, it’s 95 percent rewrite."
2,"A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success",14,"So I have two phases. There is the free-play creative phase. Then there is the polish and construction phase of, and I love to spend inordinate really, I mean, it’s not wasteful to me, because that’s just what I like to do, amounts of time refining and perfecting every single word of it until it has this pleasing flow to my ear. Then it becomes something that I can’t wait to say. And then we go from there to the stage with it. From the stage, the audience will then — I imagine, it’s a very scientific thing to me. It’s like, “Okay, here’s my experiment,” and you run the experiment. Then the audience just dumps a bunch of data on you, of, “This is good, this is okay, this is very good, this is terrible.” That goes into my brain from performing it on stage. Then it’s back through the rewrite process and then new ideas will come."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,15,"This ad free podcast is part of your Slate plus membership. I’m Stephen Metcalf and this is the Slate Culture Gabfest Sleeps with the Fishes edition. It’s Wednesday, April 14th, 2021. On today’s show, a cheese ball horror flick popped unexpectedly to the top of the Netflix rankings. We discuss what lies below and all its distinctive fishy aromas. But it’s also an excuse to explore the mysteries of the algorithm. I think we’ll talk a little bit about that and then Warn Stories is a docu series about items of clothing and how much and how deeply really they signify who we are. It’s based on Emily Spivak 2014 book. It’s also on Netflix. And finally, the vault containing all the unreleased prints. Music has at last been opened. We discussed this purported embarrassment of posthumous riches with Slate’s own Carl Wilson. Joining me today is Dan Quayle. Dan is a longtime editor and writer at Slate. He’s also the author of How to Be a Family and the co-author of The World Only Spins Forward. Dan, hey, welcome back to the podcast. Hey, Steve. And of course, Alegra. Frank rejoins us. She’s senior editor at Slate Alegra. Hey."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,15,"All right. What lies below? It checks all the boxes. There’s a remote house in the woods, a tense but loving mother daughter relationship, a creepy man who interloping on their lives. This is a very silly but I found weirdly engrossing schlock horror movie with maybe some adult overtones. I thought a classic or I think everyone thought it was just a classic Netflix throwaway. And thanks to the weirdness known as the algorithm that hit the top of the most watch list and of course, that builds on itself, more people watch because it’s there. And suddenly the thing is kind of a minor phenomenon, like a lot of old horror movies. I don’t know if I can fully classify this as alter, but. But but it aspires, I think, to be that. And it builds on some of the morbid features of ordinary life. In this instance, your mom gets a hot boyfriend and she can’t see through his bullshit."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,15,"But you do. You being Libbey, the protagonist of the movie, whose age is never specified, I think in order to keep some of the movies genuine creepiness at bay, the new boyfriend is John, a hunk to end all hunks, but also something of a science nerd. And as the plot unfolds, we discover he’s LECG and possibly some kind of Murman. Libby must somehow rescue her totally besotted mom from this undersea hottie. The movie’s written and directed by Improbably, is actually written and directed by somebody. Braiden are Dumela. Let’s listen to a clip. And just to set it up a little bit in the clip we’re about to hear, Libby, the daughter wakes up in the middle of the night only to discover her mom’s boyfriend acting very strangely."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,16,"I’m I’m pretty dry, slippery. I should have mentioned this earlier. And I’m really sorry. I suffer from somnambulism. It’s sleepwalking. I’m really sorry if I scared you. I feel like everything that I have done since you got here has been an absolute catastrophe. I have this way of. I just fuck everything up except for my research. It’s the one time that I like I work. Does that make sense? Please come back inside. I got to keep one of you healthy like"
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,17,"on? Yes. So this film, because it is worthy of the title of cinema, is so it appeared on Netflix last Thursday. So about a week ago and already had settled into like the top ten trending list, which is Netflix is like a little marquee of the things you probably should be watching as they do declare themselves. And in my time, explain. I was just trying to understand why such a film would appear there, not just from me, the economic promotional standpoint, but like what is the appeal to the general audience? And it is really just that this is an incredibly, amazingly dumb or like sexy horror fish movie that is just so weirdly enjoyable to watch in how profound its stupidity is. It’s like really, you know, it’s brief. It’s like 90 minutes. It’s very sexually tense. There’s a lot of hot white people in it doing hot white people things. And it is it is just an absolute joy to watch for about 45 to 90 minutes. I would love to hear what you guys think. As someone who just was having a blast laughing at the terrible writing and the nonsense characters and the overt and disturbing sexual tension I want to hear with the men in the room. I think,"
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,18,"What his I mean, he is a sight to behold. I’m fascinated by this notion that that this is a pure, enjoyable trash watch, in part because I had always viewed that as a sort of exclusively Gen X phenomenon, like this idea that you would willingly enjoy cheesy schlocky crap with your friends while acknowledging how bad it is. It always seemed to me to be something that Gen X had invented. And so I’m pleased to see it spanning the new generation of people who are rocketing things to the top of the Netflix top 10 list. I read an interview with Braiden ah Daimler writer, director of What Lies Beneath, who’s very proud of what has happened to his movie and very proud that it has struck a chord. And Entertainment Weekly asked him, you know, what were your goals for this movie?"
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,18,"And he said, honestly, I just wanted it to get it out of Netflix and get it into the top ten and be part of the conversation. And the idea that that that is that’s a filmmaking goal is fascinating to me. And it does suggest, as Alegra notes, that the movie is made to fulfill a very specific, essentially algorithmic purpose. It’s meant to touch in its synopsis and in its still image of this gentleman rising from the sea, his 12 pack fully engorged to appeal to a certain kind of viewer at ten forty five at night. And it works perfectly. It’s it’s a movie, Haselberger says, that is bad, yet enjoyable. That flies by it. It’s, it’s great for forty five of it’s ninety minutes and those forty five minutes can only take thirty minutes if you watch it at one point twenty five speed. This is the first thing I’ve ever been so happy to watch. At one point to five speed"
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,15,"I say I agree with every word of that. I will say that I watched it at regular speed, which made me wonder if I had accidentally clicked on point seventy five speed. Right. But I. But damn, the thing that you said, this just strikes me as totally uncanny because it explains my experience of it, which was I felt like I was back in the nineties somehow and exactly. Watching single white female or the crush or any of these kind of good, bad or bad good movies that came out around them that just had sort of all of the rhythmic comforts of genre like they set up. You know, they knew exactly how to set up a familiar set of expectations and then and then deliver on them. And I basically thought this movie did it. It’s it’s it’s obviously it’s terrible. I mean, it’s it’s but it’s just it’s deliciously terrible. There are some. Things about it cinematically that I’ll say that I actually did kind of admire, which is you have a little cabin in the woods, but he did a good job with the camera of making it seem sort of Gothic and its hallways feel sort of elongated and as if it were both tiny and claustrophobic and yet a place with the recesses that contained horrible mysteries, which, you know, it doesn’t just happen. Right. You don’t just point a camera and suddenly that, you know, feeling enters the view."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,17,"I love the point you just made of, you know, the having this single man, especially attractive man like his main John is his name, the creepy, sexy, buff fish man. He you know, he infiltrates this relationship between mother and daughter that is so close just out of nowhere. And I found that to be I mean, part of the enjoyment, because that is something I can find personally relatable. As you know, a young woman who does have a single mom or, you know, divorced parents, thankfully, I never had to go through that because my mother and I share the belief that men are just awful. So we never had men coming into the house."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,17,"No, God, I can’t even imagine my mother ever speaking to anyone like John in any capacity. But, you know, just that fear, though, of having you know, we have this safe relationship and having someone, you know, intrude upon that is quite horrifying."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,18,"Lots of minutes of very moaning. And then there’s one great scene of them having sex and the fish guy suddenly having weird alien skin while they’re banging. But I have this hypothesis with this movie that one reason that things hit the Netflix top 10 is that Americans in the year 2021 are desperate for soft core, that Hollywood has essentially abandoned sex as a storytelling device. Like all those movies you cite, Steve, from the 90s, single white female and the crushin and that and every movie of their ilk, not to mention the sort of straight to cable Skinemax movies of yore all used, you know, long, slow, soft scenes as a narrative device, not only because they attracted audiences, but because directors were interested in them and because they were cheap and filled up a lot of screen time. But that stuff isn’t it’s very rare that you see that in any kind of Hollywood movie anymore."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,18,"And on the other side of the spectrum, hardcore is everywhere. It’s all over the Internet and seemingly inescapable. And it seems to me that there’s like some middle ground that Netflix or some other streaming network could very enjoyably exploit. But this movie didn’t do it. And I wonder if even the prompt, like the the faintest hope of soft core, as evidenced in the promotional shot of John coming out of the water, a glistening is all it takes to get people to click on and watch a movie and then watch it at one point to five speed, just hoping at some point they’re going to get like four minutes of dimly lit Vaseline lensed."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,17,"facts. I think that’s a really interesting point. And it’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot, too, because there’s this one as someone who’s been paying a lot of attention to that top 10 lists on Netflix, the thing that’s been at the top of the list for like almost a month now is this show called Who Killed Sarah, which is just, you know, a really similarly stupid kind of thriller. You know, it’s about a young woman, college girl has died and who has killed her and the image like that again. Right. And the picture the thumbnail is just the girl, I think, Sarah, in a bikini like hair wet. And then sometimes it’s of the shirtless, sexy guy who may or may not have killed her or whatever. And I think probably its appeal to people who are clicking on it. And I doubt actually watching through it because I tried and it’s just awful is that it does have this promise of some lust, you know, like maybe outright sex, but mostly lust, like there is this sort of sexual tension to indulge in, which has become quite attractive to the home streamer again."
3,“Sleeps With the Fishes” Edition,15,"damn it, I was it I was about to make that joke. I got through this segment without calling it What Lies Beneath. It’s another Anselmi genre movie but that I kind of love. But anyway, it’s on Netflix. Maybe check it out, maybe not. But if you do, we’d love to hear what you thought of it. All right. Moving on.

It’s both a love fest and a war zone. But I think it’s just it’s a perennial question. How do parents tastes influence what kids listen to and then what kids listen to as adults? And how does that get passed on or not passed on? So anyway, Slate plus members can look forward to hearing that segment later in the show.

Both Jim and I take it a step further and say that you go to across the nation should be considered occupied territory, but. Oh, well, how about politics? How would you define politics by the winners? You know, elections, elections can be part of politics. And but we in a party is got a Chairman Mao’s definition of politics. He said war is politics with bloodshed and politics is war without bloodshed. Civil war is politics with bloodshed just to throw it out. That’s what I mean. It means every time the shoot down unarmed brother or sister in the street, Daley pull the trigger in made Tricky Dicky Nix is the fattest, most filthy pig in a P."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,20,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it. I think that, you know, this is a story that has been discussed to some degree, the Black Panthers, but not in such a way where characters to call them that have been sort of humanized. Like my experience with the Black Panthers is more in these sort of anodyne documentaries and are included in larger pieces on the civil rights movement. So I really appreciated getting to actually see Fred Hampton as a fuller figure, as well as the fact that this is such a, you know, an emotionally gripping story with William O’Neal, the FBI informant who ended up helping to facilitate Fred Hampton’s murder. I mean, it’s just a really intriguing story that hasn’t been told very much in the mainstream. But I’m curious to hear both of your thoughts, because also, since the film’s release, I’ve read a lot of sort of opposition about how it images Fred Hampton and politics in the Black Panthers and their influence and significance."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,22,"I mean, this is really going to be a personal reaction and not an analysis of exactly how I would have seen this movie doing anything differently. But I was a little disappointed in this movie, to tell you the truth. It had been so hyped and so praised. I was so excited to see both of these two actors who do both give brilliant performances. But there’s something muddled about the conceptualization of this movie of this to this twosome. Right? I mean, it essentially is a movie with without a lead. Both of these two guys are up for best supporting actor, which you could argue is one of those cases of, you know, quote, category fraud at the Oscars. Are they leads or they colleagues? I appreciate that the movie doesn’t have a single main character that it focuses on, but a combination of the fact that it has you know, this this big ensemble cast is a pretty epic story. You know, it’s telling the story of about three very tumultuous years in the lives of a lot of people. And there’s something kind of scattered about this movie’s focus that kept frustrating me. I kept feeling like licky Standfield endemically are so powerful as these characters."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,22,"And yet I don’t really understand the motivations, particularly of Bill O’Neil, the Keith Stanfield character, who is the FBI informant. We see a lot of scenes with him, you know, being taken out for fancy meals by the FBI agent, played by Jesse Plemons, who’s who’s working in. And I guess we get a sense that like Judas, right. As in the title, he’s doing this for the 30 pieces of silver. He’s doing this because it keeps him out of jail and it pays him money. But he stanfield’s it is an actor who brings so much complexity and intensity to this performance. There’s so much behind his eyes that I wished the script understood the character as well as he seems to be struggling to understand the character. I don’t know if either of you found this either, but actually maybe since the only audio clip we’ve heard did not involve Keith Stanfield, who arguably is the protagonist of the movie. Let’s listen to a little clip from him. This isn’t one of the scenes with Jesse Plemons, who plays the FBI agent who is implanting him as a fake Black Panther."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,21,"Hey, listen, I’m out, Roy, I’m out. Calm down. Calm down, Bill. Fucking calm down, all right? I was almost killed, man. I’m crazy in jail. I did a damn job and I’m out of work. What do you mean? That’s not how it works."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,22,"I didn’t really understand that character’s motivation. I hadn’t learned much about the Black Panthers are about Fred Hampton that I didn’t already know going in. And also that this is kind of opening up another question, but that there were just a lot of secondary and tertiary characters who were important for a few scenes, but who otherwise were people that we barely knew. And maybe that that goes to this feeling that it’s that it’s rushed. I mean, I’m the one who’s always complaining that things are padded and why do they need to be longer TV shows. But this, I think, could have been a season of TV more profitably than compressed into the running time."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,20,"Yeah, I mean, that’s something that I both found really compelling, but also sort of frustrating in thinking about the film later on is that William O’Neill is this figure that I did not have any real familiarity with other than just as a name. Right. I didn’t have any sense of who he was going into this film, but I felt like and as Dana said, I didn’t I still left without having much of that sense. And even though he is the Judas in this, you know, and the Judas in the black messiah paradigm. And we do know how his story shakes out in real life and understanding this tension of becoming really committed or becoming really involved, at least with the Black Panthers versus also having this other agenda for his own, you know, self gain. That is such a really that’s such an interesting balance that he has to maintain. And yet I felt as though I didn’t have quite the understanding or at least the sense of how much this was weighing on him, which made the the final note that, as you said, we will not give away, even though it’s always funny when it’s like, let’s not spoil this historical fact. I know. I know."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,20,I thought it was a really interesting directorial choice on the part of Shaka King who directed this film. And he’s talked a lot about how how long he’s pursued the story and finally actually realizing it. And so I found I found that choice to be interesting. And just a lot of his choices as a director I’m not particularly familiar with. Do you guys know much about Chocho King and his work?

3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,23,"I didn’t know what to expect. I wanted to stop people from. Thinking that I can Tina was so positive, I mean, he was it was that we were such a love team or a great team and it wasn’t like that. So I thought, if nothing else, at least people would know."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,23,"was one that a lot of maybe people are familiar with the husbands, that that is a practiced brutality. Yeah, yeah. Nobody talks about sexual abuse, physical abuse, domestic abuse, abuse, period. Our generation is the generation that started to break the silence."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,24,"Yeah. I mean, it’s it’s just a wonderful movie. I mean, it’s really interesting because it’s it’s actually fairly conventional in many ways. You know, it’s sort of it hits a lot of the kind of standard musical music documentary beats it precedes roughly chronologically and tells sort of, you know, fairly standard story. But it has all of these really great devices, including the use of archival interviews, which just work incredibly powerfully. Like you mentioned, the 1981 People interview, which was a total landmark. And there’s also a lot of raw audio from the interview she did with Kurt Loder for what would become ITN. And it gives this real immediacy and just intimacy. I mean, that’s like the word I keep coming back to with this documentary is just there is you feel like you are sort of living with this woman kind of for the first time, which is really incredible considering how long Tina Turner has been massively famous and how many times she has sort of put herself out there in these very courageous ways. But this feels really I don’t know, I just I think it’s really one of the one of the best music documentaries I think I’ve ever seen."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,24,"Yeah, I did. And I think they I think part of it is that there’s been a way that Tina’s story has kind of always been in some ways framed in proximity to Ike and in sort of relation to her marriage, like, you know, the first part of her career. She’s one half of Ike and Tina. And then really in the 80s and beyond, she becomes this kind of superhero survivor figure who is and, you know, you have the 1993 biopic, What’s Love Got to Do with It, which was a big hit and, you know, on a bunch of awards and stuff. But, you know, Ike is really central to that movie. And there’s a way that this documentary, without minimizing the role of Ike in her career and in her life, really feels like this is her story in a way that I haven’t read her second memoir, which was published a few years ago. But I Tina is also very much her memoir that came out in 1986, which is the basis for what’s love got to do with it is very much a lot of it’s about her marriage. And so this documentary just felt a lot more like this is me, you know, like it’s like and she kind of says that a number of times."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,24,"Yeah, I did. I mean, it’s really it’s so rare, I think, that you can that an artist has a chance, especially an artist of her magnitude has the opportunity to sort of go out like this. And it is really framed as a swan song like I mean, she seems an incredible physical shape. I mean, she’s she seems like 30 years younger than she actually is, at least. So, I mean, I don’t think Tina Turner is going anywhere anytime soon, but she does seem to be basically done with public life. And that’s made clear both by her and her husband at the end of the documentary. And there’s like a real kind of elegance to like this kind of departure, you know, and sort of leaving on her own terms."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,24,"And there’s nothing about I’m guessing the movie kind of came about in relation to the Broadway show which premiered, I think, shortly before the covid thing. I’m guessing that that’s sort of the genesis for this, you know, in terms of a sort of publicity blitz kind of thing. But there’s yeah, there’s nothing about the movie that that feels anything other than just like really beautiful. I think, you know, this isn’t something that there’s nothing about this movie that feels like it’s, you know, trying to goose catalog sales or something like that. Like it just feels it feels really natural. And yeah, again, just like this really lovely sort of farewell to her public."
3,“What’s Love Got to Do With It” Edition,22,"Rebecca, I was really struck by a moment in your essay about rereading Naomi Wolf after 30 years. At this point you made about nature and about her. It seems like there’s some sort of connection you’re drawing between her wanting to tear down, you know, what she sees as the artificiality of the beauty industry in that book. And and these things that you’re talking about now is like sensing that clouds in the sky are not a natural shape. Right. Or that children don’t smile during covid. And you have this great story from the beauty myth or example from the beauty myth, where you say that she sees women as too afraid of the sun and that you know, that there’s all these products, sunscreen. You know, the idea that the sun is a villain is this is this antifeminist gesture which again is attributed, you know, to this vague something beauty industrial complex that’s out there that isn’t within us. And that made me start thinking about just what a different generation of feminism."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,25,"I see it’s me, Paul. Oh, what are you doing here? I live here. You yes, you live here. Yes. You live here in my flat. That’s the best yet. What is this nonsense, huh? I’m going to phone at. Your daughter? Oh, yes, thank you. I know who Anne is, you know, and are you a friend of hers? I’m speaking to you. Do you know Anne? I’m a husband. Her husband is. But since when? Coming up for 10 years. Oh, yes, yes, of course, yes, yes, obviously."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,26,"Yeah, I really, really hope people will see this in spite of the subject matter. And maybe that clip makes the entire movie sound like it’s going to be. I mean, I guess you would have to say that it is depressing. It can’t be anything but depressing to watch someone fade away in the way Anthony Hopkins character does. But this movie, because of the the perspective play you were talking about, which I’m sure will get into the way, the point of view keeps slipping, has a little bit more of an intellectual puzzle quality. In other words, it works on your emotions for sure, but it also works on your perception and your intellect in this this interesting way. It’s a fantastic performance from Anthony Hopkins. I would not be surprised to see him getting Oscar attention for this movie, even if it’s the only Oscar attention this movie gets. And it’s just kind of really impressive from a technical craft point of view. This movie, the director you mentioned, Florian Zellar, who was also the playwright for this very successful play. It was a huge hit. It won the French equivalent of the Tony."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,26,"It was translated into many languages and played all over the world. And this is his first time directing a movie. So all of that to me points toward, you know, the danger, I guess, that this this would feel like we’ve talked about this many times in the past, too. Is that bad for a movie based on a play to feel like a play? That’s a whole other debate. My point is, though, that this movie doesn’t feel like a play at all. It’s got a really cinematic sensibility. And I don’t want to spoil the way that the time slippages are revealed. But there are a lot of moments that Florian Zeller’s is kind of tricking the viewer as well in the way that reality tricks the Anthony Hopkins character, who’s also named Anthony. And I believe that that was a change that was made for the movie script in order for Anthony Hopkins to really feel like he had to dig deep and to to really play himself. I think he they even gave the character the same birth date, day and year that Anthony Hopkins has."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,25,"Keep changing your mind. How do you expect people to keep up? There’s never been any question to be living in Paris. It’s what she told me. No, I didn’t. I’m sorry. I and you told me the other day you forgotten. She’s forgotten."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,27,"You’re left uncertain what’s real, which is exactly the state that that Anthony’s character is in, and that feels like the most radical impact of the film. And you can imagine it being really profound on the stage. I didn’t see it on the stage when I was in New York. But the the tricks that are played here with production design are all really effective."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,25,"So if I understand correctly. You’re leaving me, is that it? You’re abandoning me that. Well, it’s going to become of me."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,26,"Steve, you’ve now reduced me to a fugue state of desire to see Christian Barclays’ the clock again, which I still regret not having devoted more of the one 24 hour period I had access to it. I wish that I had just sat there and eaten peanuts and watch the entire thing. But yet I guess the connection makes sense in that time. And and a watch that he keeps losing is a key part of this movie as well. Right. And I don’t know if I was getting across. I mean, we’re getting across that. We like the movie and we recommend it. But it is an experiential kind of unfolding in this movie. And I think, Julia, what you said about the lack of a skeleton key is really true, especially in relation to the casting slippage. Right. The fact that there are some characters that are played by more than one actor and we’re not quite sure who he’s collapsing in his mind into these composite characters, it ends up having this sort of Moebius strip quality. Right. There seems to be one day or a couple of days that are being repeated over and over with slight variations. And it’s all done very soberly and simply."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,26,"It’s there’s no kind of like crazy canted angles and weird flashback montages and things that are trippy or psychedelic in any way. Right. It’s quite simple, but the dislocation is really profound. The music is also gorgeous in this movie. And I thought it was worth noting because it was composed by none other than Ludovico Einaudi, who have endorsed before on the show and who I put on my Winter Walk playlist. Just a great film composer who I’m going to be looking out for in the future. And maybe we can listen to a short clip just to see the way that the soundtrack weaves in and out of the movie. Here’s a scene with Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Williams, who we haven’t mentioned, who’s wonderful, who plays one of the the collapse together characters in this scene. She is a home health aide who’s coming to learn how he does things around the apartment or something."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,25,Just make sense about this doesn’t make sense to me. We met yesterday. We were just starting to get to know one another. And I said I’d come back just to see how you do things here and see if I can can help you to remember.
3,“Unreal World” Edition,28,"When we did this show, Bill Clinton was running for president. That’s right. And here we are. Twenty nine years. Yeah. And it’s the same shit. Yeah. Anita Hill was me, too. Rodney King was Black Lives Matter. It’s the same shit. And like, finally, maybe it’s incendiary enough that we will be able to put this endemic racism to bed because it’s like reaching a pustule. Now, some things have changed. Some things haven’t changed at all. The beautiful thing about the real world, I think, about American television history was the first time outside of coverage of the civil rights movement, which was mostly new stuff. We actually had a TV show where black people and white people were having really intense conversations about race and racism. We had never seen that before, ever. They will never be a show like ours. We had no reference point. It was just us. There was no reality TV. We all thought it was a documentary on seven artists that was like more in depth. We had no idea that it was going to turn into this or that it would be a reality TV show. President of the United States."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,29,"The real world did, in fact, change the course of TV history. I mean, one of the things that’s interesting about it is it sort of introduced reality TV as we know it. There had been a sort of previous documentary that, you know, a decade or two earlier that that sort of also did introduce reality TV to America. And then reality TV didn’t really stick until the early 2000s when Survivor came along. But this is definitely like, you know, it’s like one of the direct descendants of everything. And if you heard in the clip, you know, they really were seven ambitious kids who ambitions were not to be on reality TV. They didn’t really know what they were getting into. It seemed like a cool art project. They all wanted to be artists. They were doing something else, say that they’re making a documentary. And you can sort of see that in the show, which is like the sort of rote concerns of reality TV drama."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,29,"While the show established, a number of them, like they don’t know that’s what’s happening, like they’re doing it for the first time. Um, and I think I think sort of the move of the reunion has kind of been. It’s like a complicated thing, creating reality TV, right, like there very has been the show has been so far very sort of like self-congratulatory, as you heard also in that clip, you know, they did this thing for the first time. They don’t know what they were doing and it’s everywhere. But of course, it being everywhere, like, is that a good thing? You know, our first reality TV president, is that a good thing? Is like is is the extent to which it’s sort of disseminated into every corner of our culture a good thing? And I think the the reunion has sort of inoculated itself against some of those criticisms, which I actually think the participants are smart enough and thoughtful enough to have thought about by centering grace, which was absolutely a big part of the original run, but was not, you know, the only big part of the original run. You could have watched that first show and sort of thought it was just about like 20 year olds goofing around in the city and like whether Eric and Julie were going to hook up. And that was actually a lot of what the show was about."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,27,"I wonder if there’s any you know, if there’s any sense that where reality TV has landed us was inevitable like that, that for all that this particular reunion special would like us to think that the original real world was all ground breaking, cringe inducing conversations about race in America in the early 90s. In fact, like people just wanted to wonder if people were hooking up. And that was the impulse. Folks leaned in to like, what do you look at this? Do you see, you know, the original sin of there was no way for America to ever be interested in anything else. But Blond’s trying to woo each other. Maybe some brunette’s still 30 years later, like trying to interest America and people of color wooing each other, like just is is the sin of reality television emblazoned in the initial document, or was there a path not taken somehow,"
3,“Unreal World” Edition,29,"you know, in the original incarnations of the real world, like through I would say probably like Season four, the London season or maybe through Boston or something. There was this kind of cinema verité aspiration like and they were casting for people that, while interesting and attractive, did have other goals. But then it just sort of it started to eat its own tail, you know? So it’s like it’s not even it just it’s not about it’s about what the producers wanted to do, but it’s about like what’s just happening in the culture and the kind of people that want to be on a reality TV show. And it sort of just spirals out at some point. The show itself like tracked what happened with reality TV insofar as there started to be seasons where it was just about people hooking up and hot tubs until the end of the show was just people getting drunk and hooking up and hot tubs and yelling at each other all the time."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,29,"And and and to the extent that people who were like the original cast members, like a Pedro, you know, like a Heather, like a Kevin, like like a Julie, like, they would just not have agreed to do this. It was just not in line with their what they want to do. I mean, there was like Medical’s, you know, like in the seventies there was like a medical student, you know, a cartoon like this, people who just never they just like it didn’t make sense. And it’s like a tabloid story, right? Like we wanted more trash. They gave us more trash. Like if they hadn’t given us more trash, would we have been happy with not you know, I don’t like the ratings only went up. It’s like I mean, it’s sort of it’s true of everything. That’s true of Web traffic. I mean, it’s just like who who came first."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,28,"Julianne, I had the most famous argument in American TV history on race and racism. Racism is the point. We don’t have the power to control what said in."
3,“Unreal World” Edition,27,"All right. I’ve got one and a half endorsements today, or maybe one in two halves. First of all, I am in the desert. And upon driving here and arriving, it’s it’s spring break. And we rented an Airbnb near Palm Springs. And upon turning into the driveway, a road runner ran across the road in front of us. And I have never actually seen a road runner before. And there just one endorsed that bird. Great bird looks and looks looks just like the road runner. So Road Runner, that’s that’s one half hour later."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,30,"Well, I’m glad you liked it, because that’ll give us something to talk about. Oh, boy. Well, no, no, it isn’t even that I disliked this movie. It’s that I my expectations had been so built up. This appeared on many, many 10 best list last year. I had been waiting to see it for months. I had actually been putting off seeing it because I thought it was going to be so hardcore because of the subject matter and because of things that Vinterberg has done in the past. I also love the celebration, that 1998 movie that you mentioned. It is a comedy, but it’s a very, very caustic comedy about really hot button material. And so is another movie. He made the hunt he made in 2012, also starring Mads Mikkelsen. That’s about a man falsely accused of assaulting a child. I mean, he takes on really hard core social issues or personal issues and makes comedy out of them. And that’s what this movie tries to do as well. But after having put this off and put this off, because I thought, oh, I don’t know if I can go through the emotional wringer of watching these people, you know, drink themselves into oblivion. I watched it and sort of came out with is that all there is? I mean, I agree that Mads Mikkelsen is wonderful. It is an interesting idea, a dogma type idea, actually."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,30,"A sort of experiment. Right. A movie about about these men conducting an experiment the way the the Dogma group did back in the 90s with film. And Mads Mickelson’s a great actor, but there’s something underwritten about this movie that none of the characters emerged into any relief. For me, it was all a laboratory experiment, like here are four guys with no attributes, doing something for unclear purposes. And we’re watching it play out as if they’re lab animals or something like that. I mean, all this is is artfully done, as you say. I mean, Vinterberg knows how to, you know, place a camera layer in music and sound and make a beautiful artifact that’s really nicely crafted. But I don’t understand why this movie exists, which is a line I’m stealing from the critic Stefanie’s Harik for time, who we read about. And in prepping for this, it just has a motive looseness for me. And I also have to say not that every movie has to be absolutely equitable in this way, but every female character in this movie is pretty blonde woman yelling about domestic tasks that husband is not doing. So the world’s that it it showed was just so low stakes for me that it was hard for me to care whether these guys became permanent sources or lost their jobs or or had anything at stake in this whole experiment."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,30,"Yeah. I mean, I want to come around, Steve, when I hear your reading of it and I went into it really excited for it. And as I say, I enjoyed the setup, enjoy the acting, found it well done in every way, except that I just didn’t find the story believable. You know, the scientific the pseudo scientific theory that you refer to, the thing that inspires them or at least gives them a rationalization for their drinking experiment is a real thing. There is actually a Norwegian psychologist, a researcher. I’m not sure what his credentials are, but someone has put forth this idea in a book that humans need to have a point zero five blood alcohol level to to function at their maximum capacity, which has been thoroughly debunked by the observation that we don’t naturally have any alcohol in our system. So how can you say that the amount we have is too low?"
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,30,"And the idea of using that, again, I mean, as you say, it’s sort of dogma like to take this idea from the real world and folded into this fictionalized story. But there was there was a sort of a lack of just behavioral recognizability to me in in the way alcohol functions in this movie. At times, as you say it was, is this agent of chaos in their lives? At other times, it’s this agent of conviviality. Of course, that’s true of alcohol in real life as well. But again, I just felt that there was something arbitrary and lab like in the way that those standards seem to apply. For example, I mean, with a couple of exceptions, the way that they acted when drunk. And I’m not saying they’re bad actors. I’m saying that the script was having alcohol perform things in their lives that it wouldn’t actually do. It actually reminds me a bit of the Queen’s Gambit, my critique of the Queen’s Gambit. I was thinking about that. This idea that shoving pills in your mouth by the handful will make you a great chess player. It’s just a strange kind of magical thinking connection to make in relation to alcohol"
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,31,"It doesn’t have enough surface area to hold sauce. It’s not you can’t really sink your teeth into it. It’s kind of thin and flimsy. It’s splatters all over the place. When you start twirling it or sucking it in, it’s just like it’s fine, but it’s not that great."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,31,"Well, it’s funny. I was never that worried about being able to come up with. A new idea for a shape, because I feel like this kind of an infinite number of concepts, the things that I thought would be so hard would be one that was legitimately good to eat. But what what was so much harder than that was, was that part of my quest was to actually get it made and that was a much bigger barrier than I ever thought it would be. You know, like the base, the way you make pasta is like the potato factory, you know, like this. You remember it’s made with a dye. So like dye, you remember the potato factory had a little disk with a star shaped hole. You pushed Plato through it and it comes out shaped like a star. That’s how you make pasta and that little star shaped disc is called a die, so I had to get one of those manufactured and early on I hit on this idea that I wanted to have Ruffels because I love shapes, ruffles. I love Mafalda, which is like a fettuccini ruffles on the edges. And then I took me a while to come around and I warmed up to bucatini, which is like a long, narrow tube, like spaghetti that’s hollow down the center. And I said, I want a tube element and I want ruffles."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,31,"And I took that to a die maker and he started experimenting for me and he said, it’s impossible. You can’t basically, as the dough is going through the dye, the shape is formed in less than a second and you can only do so much in that split second. And the movement required to create the ruffles would crush the tube. And that was the kind of brick wall that I ran into on this quest that I never anticipated."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,31,"Yeah, it has been really cool. Like a lot of my friends, kids are like, wait, we know a food inventor, you know, like I just think that’s that’s been really cool and adorable. And I do remember us having a conflict over short and long shapes. At that time. I was very pro long shapes in my quest. I set out to create a long shape. That’s where I started. I’m basically for two reasons. First, I think I think it’s three reasons. One, when you twirl along shape on the fork, it’s just kind of like a fun thing to do to you get tend to get, I think, more pasta on the fork at once, which makes for a more to thinkable bite. And three, I think there’s less variation among long shapes that are already existing. And so therefore I thought more opportunities for innovation. What I what I learned when I tried to do a long shape is that there’s a reason why there’s less variation among long shapes, and that is because they are harder to eat and harder to manufacture."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,30,"Julia and Dan, I have so many questions for you. I absolutely loved this series. And I listen to it while doing all kinds of experiments with your pasta. I cooked up almost a whole box of it and just tried it with all different sources. Over the course of several nights, there was a period when I was making one source and as a snack while making that sauce, I was eating your pasta with another source. So there been a lot of curious noodle shapes stuffed into the mouths of my family this week. And I want to talk about what you named the shape, but I won’t spoil that yet. But I feel like we should get to a moment when all of us go around the table here and just talk about our own experience of first encountering the shape, cooking it and eating it. So on. First, seeing your noodle through the little window that’s in the box that it’s sold in. What occurred to me and this is one metaphor I didn’t hear and the many, many metaphors people were using to describe it on the show was an escargot. You know, the way a snail has that sort of frill across the top when it’s when it’s crawling along in its shell, just reminded me of and I know somebody else did compare it to a seahorse or some other sort of aquatic life. I know that’s not what you were going for in the shape, but the combination of this double row of ruffles."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,31,"I appreciate it. But my other problem is, fuzzily you get that corkscrew, it’s almost it’s too Sosebee. There’s too much sauce in that bite and you get I feel like I’m drinking sauce with like a faint hint of pasta."
3,“Monotextural Pasta Slurry” Edition,31,"Yeah, I mean, so so the way I came at the naming was kind of similar to the shape itself, which is first off, I don’t want a gimmick, I don’t want a gimmick shape. So my friends were like, oh, call it the sportin near the pashmina. I was like, no, like, those are you know, I wanted it to sound like a name that has been there all along, a policy that’s been there all along. And my favorite pasta shape names are the ones where it’s named. It’s the Italian word for something that it looks like. So radiata a little radiator’s covid tapi corkscrews orecchiette, a little ears. So I basically just asked a bunch of people, what does this look like to you? And got a ton of different responses because the shape is is unique. It also depends on how you hold it. And some some from some vantage points, it looks very different from others. A lot of people said that, look, reptilian like a dinosaur."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"I’m so happy today. So am I. Oh, my God. I feel like you’ve manifested today’s episode. Yes, we did. We absolutely. And we have been chasing this particular manifestation for a while. Yes. For as long as we have been on the air. Exactly. Yeah. It’s been a minute. It’s been a minute. And we did it. And it is everything we could have imagined and more. God, yes. Phenomenal goodness. That’s why I’m great. I can’t stop grinning. Actually, I just have teeth just like coming out of my eyes, my cheeks, my nose. I’m just I’m a I’m a walking tooth right now."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,33,"I’m just so happy because like you said, it was everything we had wanted and maybe even a little bit more. And Nicole, do you want to explain why I am mostly made of teeth today?"
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"Because we finally got to talk to Jake Johnson. Oh, my God. Turtle Bay to see Nick Miller. We make the Miller. Oh, my gravy. McConnell a beard of the beard."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,34,"You know, Jake from New Girl, of course, as you know, as Nick Miller, you know him as Peter B. Parker from Spider-Man into the spider verse, which I just saw. Fantastic. Oh, my God. Paper hard drinking buddies."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,33,"And now he’s an Stumptown and he’s got a new show that’s coming out on Netflix on Friday, the 21st of August. It’s called Hoopes. He plays a foul mouthed basketball coach of a hopeless high school team. It is raucous and noisy and actually a bit of a departure from the other things that you have seen and loved him in. But it’s also got its own, you know, screechy charm."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"Oh, so, I mean, and it was such a good interview. I mean, he’s he’s a professional. He’s funny. He’s sweet. Yes. He knows his craft like it was. Yes. Yes. It was just everything you would want to interview with an actor to be. Yes."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,33,"And an actor that you actually really enjoy watching. Like there was something for me of the pure pleasure of seeing someone whose face is so familiar to you in a very specific context. And then suddenly they’re in the closet talking into a mic. And, you know, and somehow you’re kind of like, oh, my God, the magic is intact. Oh, my God, they’re still such a good actor and such a good like, you know, like it’s that wonderful, kind of like perfect alchemy of the situation where it just feels like, oh, my God, yeah, this was meant to happen. So like you said, it did feel way like a manifestation of what has been years of wanting to interview this person. And we did it. So shout out to you, Jake, because you became flesh for one night only on ASIMCO."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"I and it was probably within that first minute. So, yeah, I loved it. I was like, there it is. Honestly, I checked it off of a little bit girls. I was like, yep, Chicago, Chicago. People love to tell you that from Chicago. We had our incredible producer share. You know, she was on the call as well. And Jake Peep that she was from Chicago because she was representing in her Chicago Cubs shirt. And he thought and he had a little moment with Cher. I love. Yeah, he was just a dream. Just a dream. I’m yes, I have come away from that interview."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,33,"Yes. Smiling like a loon, but also with just so much more affection for Jack Johnson. Like, I was like, you know, I like you as a performer, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like I like you as a person. You seem like such a nice guy, right."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,33,"I decided I feel like all our interviews are great, but this one really feels very special in addition to all of our other great. I wouldn’t rank them because that’s like saying which of my kids is my favorite? There’s no such thing. But I will say that every new interview becomes my favorite interview. And I think with this one in particular, we were on fire. There’s no two. I can’t even mince words. We were just great guys. I can’t explain beyond the simple fact of the matter. Nicole and I were asking amazing questions and Jake was giving us fantastic answers. And at one point I kind of was just like making a mental note like, oh, my God, this is it. This is the dream. This is my job. And I can’t believe I get to do this."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"It was just it was just so good. I can’t think of anything else to say except that it was just so good. And yes, Tutut, we are tooting our own horn because we are fantastic. Yes, we are. And on that note."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,35,"And here for your pleasure, Jake Johnson, just sitting in my closet doing press for three days."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,He’s a he’s a piece of human garbage.
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,"Well, you know, it’s different. This one this one started about seven years ago. Right. So Ben Hoffman came to me with Chris Miller and Phil Lord, I think it was after season one, a new girl, and said that there was a pilot presentation for an animated show that had this to the opening. You saw where he’s yelling at the refs to transition into the locker room scene with the players to transition into trying to get the talk at a prostitute in order to play. He said MTV was interested to give us the pilot presentation and he said as an idea, let’s be as loud and ridiculous as we can so that they have to pass on it. But let’s not water it down. So I came from a family in Chicago with a lot of big, loud characters. And so growing up, vulgarity was just funny in my house. You know, as I got seasoned in this industry, it was taught to me that, like, going blue or going vulgar is a cheap way to get a laugh. But that’s not how I came up. I came up with if I was nine and dropping F bombs on, my uncles were laughing that I was funny. So it was fun to be in the booth and just kind of let it rip. And then MTV passed, which is what I assumed they were going to do. And everybody passed Comedy Central, saw TBS, saw it, nobody wanted it. And the program the show died in about a year ago. Netflix came around and bought it for ten."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,"So all of a sudden, we had 10 episodes for a concept of a show that I’m not sure would work in twenty twenty, you know, and neither was Ben Hoffman, we were like, well, this is a really loud, ridiculous show that doesn’t have a message, doesn’t really have a point of view. It’s just jokes and it’s jokes for the sake of jokes. And we had a conversation. Do we water it down and kind of change it? And we said knowledge is lean in on what it is. It’s a loud, ridiculous show about a bad basketball coach who’s unhappy and he screams for 10 episodes. And our goal was to then cast it with the funniest people we could so that nobody backs down. So ever. But if you look at the cast list on IMDB, yeah, everybody’s funny. Everybody’s a comedian, everybody’s a killer. So we tried to get as many people in the booth together improvising and being funny. And, you know, that’s the show."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,34,"Yeah. Yeah. So who takes place in Kentucky? And obviously there are a lot of Southern characters in there, but your character, Ben, doesn’t really have that much of a Southern accent. It was that your way of just sticking to your Chicago roots and keeping Chicago from the cold?"
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,"That’s a good question. You know, Ben’s from Kentucky, so he wanted Kentucky. I don’t have the ranges and I’m not going in there being like, hey, man, I’m coach beer. I’m not doing that level of there’s a level of hackery I’m happy to do, but I don’t think I could take myself seriously talking the way I talk in that show where I’m like, listen, you motherfucker, you got like now I got to do it in my own accent. And then Ben was good with it. But, you know, the truth is that Ben is people I’ve seen on Instagram, people are making sure we’re not going after Kentucky on this show. And we’re not you know, Ben’s a Kentucky boy, so we’re not going after the South that we’re not trying to make fun of Kentucky. The reason I don’t have an accent and Natasha does is because she could do an accent like and the reason Rob Riggle doesn’t is no one wanted to hear Rygiel with a Southern accent. So it really was a deal. Dealer’s choice, 80 miles could doing. Cleo Kane, who plays the principal, doesn’t have one, but it just because Cleo came on a new girl and she was so funny that we just cast her to be her on it. All right. So some do, some don’t. But, you know, it was really dealer’s choice. It’s when people showed up, we would honestly ask you to do an accent."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,"Well, we didn’t we didn’t want to do just generic Southern. So we, like Ben, can do a Kentucky. So he’s like, well, if I hear it, if you’re doing like a Southern, like not all Southern accent are the same. Correct. And so we were I was like, man, you’re entering a conversation for hoops that I’m not getting involved in. I’m not getting paid a lot of money to do this. This is a, you know, soft mark swearword show. Like, let’s just do what it is. I’m not learning a Kentucky accent for it in the dialect coach. No, I’m not doing a darn good for hoops. I’m just not doing it."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,37,"But no, you know, honestly, for this one, you know, a lot of characters, I try to bring a lot to myself, too, and I try to find my way into it. I really didn’t with this character. This is not a character that I feel deeply connects to me or who I am or what I believe in. I came up during 20 years of comedy before I started working as an actor. At about eighteen, I started hitting comedy stages and for years it was just comedy. For the sake of comedy. There was I was a comedy nerd. I loved. All I wanted to do was make people laugh. And that’s kind of fading. You know, as I’ve gotten older, things mean different stuff now. So you take projects thinking about what’s going to happen with it and what this project means, who’s going to watch it. And honestly, at first that was so cool and it felt so new to be like thoughtful, but now everybody’s so thoughtful. But I just had a feeling of, like, fuck, man. I just miss doing a comedy show where it doesn’t have any messages to it. There’s no hidden anything. It’s just trying to entertain. And what I’ve been saying impress them."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,34,"Uh huh, yeah. What what’s the kid’s name who always has his underwear pulled up. And I like him because he always like this don’t make no damn sense. I really like that. Like his hook. Which one. Like with a little Pignol."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,"You know, I’ll be honest, and I don’t mean just to say no to a question, but no, what I loved about the show is it wasn’t cathartic. I didn’t learn anything. I didn’t have, like, big epiphanies. I didn’t grow. I would go to a record like you like what I did, Skydiver’s. There were times I was doing that, that the material would be so strong. Then I would feel emotional. I’d be like, wow, like this is cool. There were moments of New Girl when we’d be doing a scene. And I would feel like, man, there’s a real energy in this area. These characters are becoming real. This is something what I liked about Whoopsies. I never felt anything. It was like you would go to work and there was a microphone and an actor would pop in and we would do some jokes. We would record some jokes. Hopefully we would laugh a lot and then we would leave. And I’m like, man, that was really it’s cathartic. And looking back, the fact that it was so light. I say that it’s a light, even though it’s a disgusting show, but I like doing something where I’m like, yeah, this was this is just what it was just whoops. I mean, people like it."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,36,"I would love to make more. It’s fun. And in terms of like when we were in the writers room, we were breaking stories. Most writers rooms are so intense and you’re talking about characters arcs. And if somebody does something, you’re like, well, how do we make that make sense? If somebody had a funny joke for a character, it was going in in the changes, the character a little bit. That will be fine. Maybe it’s going to be just fine. Like so we’re saying Coach does not. Yeah, yeah. It’s funny. So now he just does that and it’s just fun. So I like that aspect of it. I can tell you being very emphatic, it was fun, guys, it was fun. Well, I’m honest. I’ve done so much development in the last few years. I’ve written in, you know, 20 projects that studios or networks have canceled. The last minute I shot pilots, I’ve had dream projects that meant a lot had a message. They didn’t let me make it. And I’ve had these conversations over and over about each character’s arc and what it means and blah, blah, blah. We didn’t do any of that and it got on TV. So I’m like, I’m not a wall."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"I mean, it would be it would be a way to go. Not the best way, though. That’s what I wanted to ask. You’ve already kind of mentioned pizza of into the spite of us. So for me and for many people who watched that, he was very much relatable, crying in the shower icon for a whole generation. How how does that still kind of how do you feel about that all this time later? Because it was one of those movies where I think everyone watched it and said, well, it’s a masterpiece, like it is a masterpiece. And, you know, I watched interviews where you would talk about the making of it and how it was such a long process. What was what does that the legacy of that car have been for you personally?"
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,37,"I got Phil Lord would like send me, you know, early material on it. And that was one of the I’m not first of all, I’m not a big comic book guy. All right? So I didn’t I don’t I probably seem to Marvel movies in its entirety. I haven’t seen all the Star Wars. I don’t care about it. So when Peter Parker first came my way through film, I thought, like, man, I’m not sure I’m the guy because there are people who love this so much. But then when I started hearing the version of Peter Parker, where he was Peter Parker, who got tired of being Spider-Man and was a very human version of it, it felt like, man, this is like an indie movie version of Peter Parker."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,38,"I got to tell you, I feel I’m with you on that because, you know, being on the television show as an actor, you never know when another job is coming. And I’m grounded in my life. So I do know what it’s like not to have a television job. So having that level of work, having an income, there was a lot that I really loved, weren’t like in my co-stars having a work situation where I know what the thing is. When we were going away, then Fox was being pretty cool and saying, like, we don’t want to cancel you, but nobody’s watching. So when we did our final season, we got eight episodes, season seven. Well, Zooey Deschanel and I literally wrote a letter, an email to the heads, to Dana Walden and Gary Neuman, the heads of Fox and 20th, asking for more for like the few Oggi fans who stayed with us because we’re like, you can’t end the way Season six ended where it was rushed. It went to give Liz Meriwether the time to finish this. Right. But when we finished that show, a lot of shows were in there, like the final episode."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,32,"We were I was watching it. This is I was still living in the UK at the time and it would come on on Channel four. And I was like, OK, let me it was I think it was Friday night, like nine thirty. And I was like, this is peak Friday night. And like I began watching it and I was like, Oh, I love this show. And then now that, you know, especially with Pandemic and people watching and watching and every so often someone’s like, why didn’t anyone tell me about the show? And I get really, really? And I’m like, I’ve been yelling about this show for five years. How dare you? Yeah."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,39,"I am so excited about this because, you know, we have been trying to figure out, one, how to incorporate our love of romance novels into Thursday kid overall for a very long time, and then to how to get our favorite authors, some of our favorite authors on the show in a way that, you know, felt good for us. And so filling out some kind of nosy questions and having them answer it just really it’s very much us checking off a major task on our list. So attack task maybe."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,40,"And it’s when he leaves the agency and it’s kind of crickets and he’s saying he will go with me. He’s got the goldfish in the bag. And Renee Zellweger says at the last minute, I will go with you. And it’s just it’s a really nice scene. And you really feel for both of them. And it establishes a lot of character. And I even like the fact she’s called Dorothy Boyd, which is a really kind of cute rather than sort of glam name. Is it sort of, you know, Dorothy Boyd feels like so when you might want to. So I really like that. I’m not at all to be making the connection because I only realized it’s after a chosen Jerry Maguire, my favorite of my own meet cute in my books is my first book. You have me at Hello. Which of course is a very famous line for Jerry Maguire. I didn’t actually choose the title you either, so I can get out of that one. But anyway, yes. So my heroine Rachel is a king in Freshers Week to be very hung over."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,40,"I think it’s a typical student and she’s getting her student card laminated. And I love interest. Ben is the one behind the desk doing the laminating as a volunteer. And I just like it because I suppose it’s that sort of week. You know, early weeks, anybody’s been to university or college, remembers, you know, the sort of hollow homesickness you have, which seemed a really good kind of high stakes moment to meet somebody so interesting to you. And then later at the end of the book, Ben. Talks about how it wasn’t love at first sight, it was familiarity at first sight because he just knew he felt he knew her already and he also felt he knew she was going to matter to him. And obviously, she feels vice versa. So, yes, that that would be the favorite of my books."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,41,"As far as which of my characters meet, cute’s is my favorite. It’s probably the right swipe because the characters, me, you know, you might have guessed it from the title on a dating app. And I feel like that’s true for a lot of couples these days. We’re just a generation that’s facilitated by technology everywhere, including our love lives. And, you know, despite how common it is, I think that there’s still this prevalent idea that if you meet on a dating app, the Meet Cute is just different or not is special because you’re meeting over text. But if I asked couples who have met online or on apps about their make you, you know, sometimes they’ll just be like, yeah, yeah, we met on X Y the app, but usually they go into more detail like there’s a story there. For example, I met my boyfriend on Bumble and my opening line was important question."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,41,"Uh, I started writing romance novels when I was 26, and I have gone on a lot, a lot, a lot of first dates since then, maybe more than the national average, I’m not sure. And in the beginning I would just kind of sidestep it, like I’d just say, oh, I’m a lawyer and nothing else. And I didn’t feel ashamed exactly about being a romance author, but there was a part of me that just dreaded the reaction I might get from someone who wanted me to feel shame, if that makes sense. But then, you know, I got to a certain age and I was just like, screw this. Let’s let’s turn this to our advantage. Let’s make it into a test to see if there’s going to be a second date. So I lean in real close and I wouldn’t blink. You know, you might want to miss anything. And I’d say, well, I’m a lawyer, but I also write romance novels and then I mentally rank their response. The worst was always some form of gross lechery. So do you, like, do all the stuff that’s in those books which, you know, if you get asked this question, I think the only appropriate response, whether it’s true or not, is, yeah."
4,A “Two Appetizers” Kinda Guy,41,"Yeah, I do. But if you say it carefully enough, there’s never really any follow up questions. And the good reaction was always some form of like, oh, cool. You know, like, oh yeah, I can I can take that, I can work with Ucore, but if I think back on it, the best relationships that I’ve had, the first response was always well above. Oh cool. And that makes sense because this is something that I love and I’m passionate about. And the best partners in my opinion, are the ones who are going to support you in doing something you love and you’re passionate about whether they understand it or not. And in fact, if they don’t understand it, there should be even more excited and interested about it on that first date because they’re excited about you and interested in you."
4,A Dog Called Rex,42,"Serious pushed his roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snake whipping his boat as he went, Snape whipped out his own."
4,A Dog Called Rex,45,"I’m great. I’m great. As a quarantine, there’s a lockdown. Or maybe there isn’t. I feel like it’s a fever dream that we all had collectively and we’re slowly waking up out of it. It’s very midsummer’s night’s dream. But, you know, I’m here. I’m here. I’m upright. I’ve been cooking a lot. And hopefully, once the world opens again, I can cook a lot less and eat meals that were not made by my own hands once again."
4,A Dog Called Rex,44,"Yeah. You know, I kind of feel like we came out of the fever dream of the quarantine lockdown. We’re actually stuck a little bit in it. And then I woke up and like my foot was amputated and the world was burning. And we’re having this revolution going on. And you know that, too. So there’s still a lot happening."
4,A Dog Called Rex,46,"Amazing. That was the Milky Way you look and like in the world. And I’m so proud of you for doing equally ashamed as I am proud. It makes me giggle people sugar. So go on that out there like that other way. No, no, no. That was a trash talk."
4,A Dog Called Rex,44,"And so far, we’ve got a special guest with us in our virtual studio today. Bill, who do we have in the House?"
4,A Dog Called Rex,43,Go wild. Go crazy.
4,A Dog Called Rex,42,"Thing is, I’m thrilled to be here. You sound it. Come on. Here we are. All our Zoome windows are us in our homes where this is the podcasting and how we’re doing it now. And it is very strange time for myriad reasons. A very sad, scary, strange time. So it is, I will say, delightful to be locked away in my closet chatting with U2 today. So a highlight of an otherwise very dark and unsettling day."
4,A Dog Called Rex,45,"Amazing thing. That’s always my aim is to be highlights an unsettling day. So, Jason, I know that this is, like he said, a sort of a difficult time. What have you been doing in quarantine to make yourself feel like a human being?"
4,A Dog Called Rex,42,"You know, I I’m I’m starting to get worried that I’m not doing enough to make myself feel like a human being. I feel like I’m slipping into, like, automated life."
4,A Dog Called Rex,47,"And then kind of to your point, a lot of I started traveling a lot more for work and it started to feel a lot more difficult to maintain. Having a dog, because you would either require like boarding that dog all the time or, you know, having it just felt like it would be contributing to a more chaotic life for the dog. Right now, though, yeah, I wish I did. And have and have now. You know, I know a lot of a lot of people are fostering dogs right now. And for a while they were saying a lot of shelters are empty, which is wonderful. But I have thought about doing that now, kind of assuming I think I can presume right now going forward, it’s still going to be a while until there’s such a time where I’m traveling to the degree that I was you know, I don’t think we’re going to jump straight back into touring the podcast that I do or I don’t think I’m going to. I just I spent three months in London on a job last fall. Like, I don’t think I’m going to be jumping around a lot more. So why not?"
4,A Dog Called Rex,42,"Yeah. And it’s and I mean, and to be selfish about it, you know, would I I genuinely believe I think it would be it would very much improve my mood and to be, you know, and, and hopefully like to get a dog out of a shelter would be wonderful. You know, so you know, it’s a Win-Win. Yeah. Let’s do it. Bam! Let’s do it."
4,A Dog Called Rex,44,"I adopted a cat in the middle of all of this. Oh, no. He’s over here in the corner watching me and like the creepy boyfriend she is. She really has, like, saved me because I don’t know what would have happened in the last, like, month and a half if I did not have this other heartbeat with me in my apartment. Yeah. Y’all adopt a dog together? Yeah. I love it. You know, Jason, when you’re traveling, you could just drop it off in New York for burping right here."
4,A Dog Called Rex,47,"And I hosted with Paul Scheer and June Diane Rayfield. And it’s usually the three of us, plus a guest. Have we’ve watched a bad movie? Kind of. The idea behind it is we’ve watched a bad movie and that bad movie can be anything from like the room or Bird Demick or like really bad kind of cult movies to we do all the Fast and Furious movies and the meg and fun stuff like that. And so we have a guest on and we will talk about that stuff and what I’m very lucky or will you know, we’ll do it live. We do it in the studio. And for the most part, this is just me and friends. You know, Paul, in June, I’ve known for 20, almost 20 years now. Most of the guests are people like Adam Scott or Nick Croll or, you know, Chelsea Peretti or all these people who are similarly our peer group and our friends. And so I’ll say there is no real preparation other than a willingness to like and in excitement generate genuinely to get onstage or to get into the studio with friends of mine. Because I know that what the show is really is a conversation amongst friends. And that’s what I think people like about the show. And that’s what I like about doing the show. Like, that’s I will say one of the things I’m missing the most in quarantine is performing. I just really I’m a I’m myself an enormous podcast fan. And so I get excited to go on other podcasts to talk to people who are themselves excited about the stuff they’re talking about. And when I was told that you guys your episode was you guys excited about me?"
4,A Dog Called Rex,45,"So it’s remarkable because when you’re recording these episodes, Nicole and I are kind of in our own world. We know what we’re there to talk about. And it sounds weird to say, but I never, ever imagined the person that we’re talking about ever hearing it, like ever. Yeah. So it’s incredibly odd to be speaking to you about you. I’m going to have more questions. But it’s very it’s like once we have the confirmation that you were going to be on. I kind of had like a very mild stroke. Sure. And I thought, OK."
4,A Dog Called Rex,42,"And I just I just kind of clocked it and I was like, OK, I don’t care. And then we kind of kept going. And in the middle of the meeting, talk turned to podcasts in general. And how what a what is surprising? You know, a big part of societal pop culture is not podcasts. And everybody’s sharing podcasts the way they used to share TV or movie recommendations and blah, blah, blah. And this is that. And I if somebody asked if I had a podcast, I said I did. And I started to describe it. And the woman who I was having a meeting with said, oh, I feel like I’ve heard that podcast before. And I was like, oh, here we go. And then I was like, and it’s like, oh, yes. We did an episode on the movie The Snowman, which you have on your bookshelf over there. And she was like and you could see it wash across her face because she was like, oh, oh, I did listen to that episode of that. I said, like, oh, no. And it was really it led to a very funny conversation. But I was for a moment like, oh, right. We talk about this stuff."
4,A Dog Called Rex,42,"Gross perverts, you know, monsters, charming, hopefully lovable monsters. But, yes, I mean, to to your question, I would like to be considered to play that both the guy that the girl wants to date, you know, like, why can’t I be like I’m in one of the side stories in like the romantic comedy, How to Be Single. And I’m just a guy that runs a bookstore and marries Allison Aubrey in that movie. And to me, I’m like, why can’t I do more of that? Like, that’s nobody was like up in arms when that happened. Nobody was like, no, we won’t allow that. You know, it’s it’s fine. So. Yeah. No, I’d love to. I wish that I was considered more for roles like that, for roles in which I’m not the guy who sadly, though I think it is a lot of times I am cast as the guy that’s like, well, after she broke up with that guy and decided to go crazy. She dates this guy who is the worst."
4,A Dog Called Rex,44,"So to go back to these action movies that you’re watching from your childhood, are these places where you kind of found figured out like your models of masculinity and like who you wanted to, like, be like the kind of man of the kind?"
4,A Dog Called Rex,45,"Oh, my God. I love my life. I think I say this all the time. But I imprinted on Bruce Willis for the longest time. I could not be attracted to someone unless they smoked exactly like Bruce Willis. Smoked as David. Yeah, like I was obsessed with David outas and I feel like he is I’ve I’ve expounded on this theory before, but he is the godfather for so many characters. I feel like without David Addison, there is simply no Nick Miller, a new girl. Yeah. It just doesn’t happen. Like, these people are like direct descendants of a special kind of character. Yeah. David, I think is just like, amazing."
4,Conscious Coupling,46,If I were quarantined with.
4,Conscious Coupling,47,I would let him. And then we would.
4,Conscious Coupling,46,"Oh, boy, you get that out of your system somehow. Yeah, I feel much better now. Okay, good. Fellows, lightless, we wanted to take a moment and say thank you once again for your membership and support, which has become more important than ever, especially in times like these. You’re helping everyone at Slate do the work that they do and we’re doing our best."
4,Conscious Coupling,48,"Put out the best work for you. Now, if you’re a reader of Slate as well as a listener, you might have heard that Slate.com recently installed a paywall. But as Slate Plus members, you have access to everything on the Web site. As long as you’re a member, you will not hit a paywall. All you have to do is sign in as slate that com slash log in that slate, dot com slash log in. And if you have any questions about your account, you can email us at plus at Slate dot com."
4,Conscious Coupling,46,"Hi, Ben. Hello, Nicole. I feel like we’re both very self-conscious about not purring at each other today. You know what? I don’t my purring at you. Thank you. It’s good to shut up. Paul told me everything I need to know. Well, I’d rather you did a pair at me, you weirdo. That’s fair. I get that. Oh, boy. Yeah. So what’s shakin? How’s everything going over there in your part of the world? You, me, my apartment’s you."
4,Conscious Coupling,48,"How are you doing other than hating my very place of existence? And now I’m I’m still doing OK, I guess. But I have reinstalled some dating apps that I deleted. So I’m just like, I need a man to pay attention to me some kind of way. And even though everybody is locked inside, still men do not know how to have a conversation."
4,Conscious Coupling,46,"So congratulations, you played yourself. Seriously, I think I’m thinking about uninstalling everything again because it’s just I shouldn’t have to pull teeth. Like we’re all tired and horny and bored. Just talk. You know, like what you’re saying is not interesting."
4,Conscious Coupling,49,"Nicole, listen, I deleted all those apps a while ago because I knew that there be monsters. And I just didn’t want to have to deal with that at this time. Like, I’m already under a lot of needless stress. I’m far from home. I am tired all the time. I feel like I’ve been battling a series of demons, like just one after the other, sometimes multiple demons at once. So I really wasn’t trying to add to that. People being just unable to engage in human interaction."
4,Conscious Coupling,50,"Well, you know, I think that’s what I’m going to do. I go through those phases where I delete the apps and I think I’m going to do them again. Plus, we here at Thursday, Kate, we have a hiatus coming up and that will help free my mind."
4,Conscious Coupling,49,"But I’m glad you brought up the hiatus, because I know that people have been sending us messages, whether on Twitter or email or on Tumblr, to say how we are an essential part of their quarantine situation, whether that’s going back into the catalog or it is listening to stuff that we’ve been doing these last few weeks. And, you know, people are just being really supportive and kind as they always have been. To be fair. Right."
4,Conscious Coupling,50,"We are not disappearing. We’re just taking a break. Probably still a little active on Twitter with any particular announcements or if anything. You know, incredible happens. Like, I don’t know, Mark Ruffalo leaves his wife and marries me hyper specific."
4,Conscious Coupling,48,"But if anything like that happens, you know, you should look out for news and other announcements on our Twitter page just in general. You never know what you’re going to see. And we’ll let you know when we’re coming back. But we are coming back. We are coming back."
4,Conscious Coupling,49,"I love how we had to reassure guys. We are coming back. But before we go, we have this one episode to give to you a little parting gift so that you can remember us over the next few weeks. Nicole, this is tied into a lot of quarantine activity. You know, I think a lot of us, as we’ve mentioned in previous episodes, a lot of us during this time, those of us who are able to stay at home and work from home and just generally be at home are reaching for familiar and comforting things. So for me, that meant watching Bones with hopefully a more critical eye, but still very much loving the central relationship between Brennan and Booth. Nicole, I know you’ve also been watching some stuff like Superstore and other sitcoms as well."
4,Conscious Coupling,48,"I’ve been watching stuff that’s still currently on the air, like super, as you mentioned, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Good girls, of course. As we mentioned in our episode about many Montana A. Just like every, you know, all that kind of stuff. But I’ve also. Yeah, been living on Netflix and Amazon Prime came back through stuff that I’m you know, that I’m already familiar with, that I know how it’s gonna end. There’s no question. There’s no there’s no mystery. And it’s also just fun to like, you know, when you’re with rewatching the stuff to see all the hints and other clues that were dropped beforehand. And when it comes to certain things like, oh, you know, that will they won’t they couple that ends up getting together and then you go back and you see all these little things that have been planted, you know, all the crumbs that we’ve been following. Right."
4,Conscious Coupling,49,"Right. All this to say for the shows that we have been rewatching. There are certain couples that sort of embody the idea of, you know, real love, true love, lasting love, blah, blah, blah, love. And there’s something about watching those couples get together. That is it feeds the beast in me that needs certainty."
4,Conscious Coupling,49,"Like right there in the bowling alley. Like what? And I remember you tweeting about it and you were like, oh, my God, Leslie’s me. And I am Leslie. Like, I also want to clamber across, like, the bowling alley and jump into his arms. The thing about the show, as you mentioned, is that they also each other, each other’s person. But what I really, really, really love about Ben and Leslie is that they are both very good people separately. And yet somehow together they are better, like each person pushes the other one to be the best version of themselves. And that means tamping down their worst urges and raising up their best urges. And that’s not necessarily that they are changing each other."
4,Conscious Coupling,49,"It’s really just a case of just allowing the best facets of their personality to kind of come to the fore. Both of my finest, happiest examples of this is actually in the episode where they get together. So this is Season 4 and we’ve seen them kind of dance around their attraction. Anyway, on this final project that they’re supposed to be doing, which is the smallest park in Pawnee, the littlest park, she invites him to that little park after they’ve had this massive falling out. And she does something that I don’t think a lot of TV shows do or even do nearly as well. She is emotionally naked. She opens up. She puts herself on the line, knowing full well that it could end really badly for her."
4,Conscious Coupling,51,"I’m trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate here. Hevesi, but only if you want to. OK. Want to? I never listen to what you wanted or how you wanted us to be when things ended between us. I just decided what I wanted and I got upset when you didn’t want the same thing. I know that’s not fair. I’m very sorry. Well, thank you, I appreciate it. If you don’t want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand."
4,Conscious Coupling,51,"There is another option. We could just say, screw it and do this thing for real. Well, I miss you like crazy. Think about you all the time. I want to be with you. So let’s just say screw it."
4,Conscious Coupling,50,"And then, you know, we start seeing that, oh, is there going to be something between Ben and Leslie? And it just moves. It doesn’t move like too quickly, which again, there’s such of a delicate art to making sure that couples get together. You know, it can’t be too soon. It can’t be too far away from the start of everything. But I think the way that they begin to notice each other and see each other and, you know, just kind of recognize that something is happening here."
4,Conscious Coupling,52,"You’re over your man. It’s costing. That’s really helpful. So welcome. I was thinking about you when I wrote it. It was because I told you I wanted to read it. Yeah, a good reason. Anyway, Chris wants to see us in his office. I guess we should head over there. All right. All right. I’ll see you there. I’ll see you there. Benjamin. Ben. All right, Leslie. Leslie. Hi, Ben."
4,Conscious Coupling,53,"Oh, hey. You forgot her name. She literally was like, who? What’s so amazing?"
4,Conscious Coupling,52,That was the most sexual tension I have ever seen in a conversation about documents. It can’t happen. We can both get fired. It’s a dumb rule. I know you have to follow it. I want to suggest avoiding one on one tensioning situations with your own good plan.
4,Conscious Coupling,53,"I still remember Nicole when dealing with Winnie the Pooh. Thank. Yes. Honey, honey, what do you. Why? Why?"
4,Conscious Coupling,54,"Who? This period of lockdown? Well, here’s the thing. There aren’t many. I don’t feel like in the last two years, even though we’ve done such fantastic work in terms of really putting them out there. You know, I was adamant that there’s a real, I would say, market for people who love not like fairies, but people who love animated cartoons and things like that. But so far, I feel like I’m not really good at anything. Great. I’m trying to see what this Robin Hood is going to look like. I thought the last thing that we’ve had that was supposed to be somewhat I don’t know if the last thing I saw was Sonic, I guess. But you know how so I’m not I’m not too impressed at the moment. Not too impressed. I haven’t seen anyone that really catches my eye. The last person was tunnels, which is why I stopped him. However, one person did just come to mind. I’m still in the same arena of being animated and also part animal."
4,Conscious Coupling,54,"He’s got a gold pierced in like he dresses like. I don’t know. He wins. He’s got a fur coat, like fireline coat. He’s got like a texture. He’s hot. I’m telling you. And honestly, when I was on Twitter, I wasn’t saying anything about DA. I did not tweet about the dark skin because I said, you know what, I fancy him, but I don’t want anyone. Everyone else is fat because I feel like this is a safe space. I can. Other than the judgments I do receive is the safest space for me to trivia. But I was like to keep to myself. But I just see tweets to people not wise. Do I actually find guy? I don’t know if you have seen what he looks like or have seen him in the show, but he’s seen."
4,Conscious Coupling,53,"They’re light skinned ox on the show. Like there’s something about him being dark skinned that I think plays a role in this season. Darren, That was just my personal preference to categorize him. I would like our duck skin. OK. I see. Allegedly. I was like, oh, yeah. He’s a wonderful, beautiful basketball. Of course, my boyfriend. Yes, that’s exactly."
4,Conscious Coupling,54,"You’re right. There was actually Dyleski’s. I’m actually just not emotionally stable enough to watch that film. I think that numerous people had said that it made them cry and it was just so beautiful inside. And sometimes I just I’m like, you know what? You guys can keep it. That’s fine. You keep you keep the sadness. And I’ll stick with the. I can’t do it. But I I’ve I’ve looked I brought up the picture of this person and I’ve got some questions. Go on. I was judged. From my earlier comments whilst Willes while the stapler. I’m not to blame about funnels, okay. Uh-Huh. Now taking the the buckin or however people describe the side and also might be a killing half of the hotplate that’s taken out the statue statue wise. I don’t really see how how different it is. Matt. Is it Maui? Yes. 4 from families that are saying how can you not fundamentals. But you can’t see him. Please. I would love to discuss this."
4,Conscious Coupling,54,"OK. That is accurate, I’d say. You know what? The angry penis. Purple. Wow. You put it that way. You’re right. You’re actually good."
4,Conscious Coupling,54,"I believe we just stand up on my pose, you know, sisters. I believe that it only applies to the animated his here’s. I think that the live action remake that they did of STONKING, they made it more animal. Right? I would say that coming for me."
4,Thirsting in Place,55,"I walk into the hotel sauna. The steam parts for a moment and I see that Rodrigo, Tessa Giardina and Henry are already seated."
4,Thirsting in Place,55,"Yes, in a very big way. It turns out that’s the physical presence of Nicole and I in a room creates its own little magic. And that’s just between the two of us. Also, our producer is at another location share. So it’s kind of like three people over a cauldron, but we’re all whipping up our own spells in our own little huts. And so together it’s like, yeah, sure, it’s good, obviously, because we’re experts, professionals, but it’s a little bit more difficult to gauge everything. Right. I didn’t realize. Nicole, how much I required looking at your face. See, you kind of execute some kind of thirsty dance move."
4,Thirsting in Place,56,"Hello, Nicole. How are you today? Let’s see. I’m trying to be present and mindful, et cetera, and figure out how I’m feeling. And it turns out my vocabulary is not that big because I’m like, I don’t know."
4,Thirsting in Place,57,"You know, from my headphones now. But back then, I could look into the whites of your eyes and be like, wow, she is really actively thirsty."
4,Thirsting in Place,58,"Like, you know, we can have that kind of silent communication when we’re ready to move on to the next person or whatever the situation may be. And right now, we don’t have that. And it’s you know, it’s it’s you know, we’re still making magic happen. But like you said, it’s a little more challenging."
4,Thirsting in Place,55,"But all that to say, we have been super grateful for all of our listeners who have been just incredible at lifting our spirits, who have been so great. As we mentioned last week at just telling people about us, making people aware of our back catalogue, we have multiple episodes, just like so many of your faves. Definitely our faves. And I feel like we are now at the place where people say, you know, people will put a request out and say, oh, I’m looking for a podcast. And without fail, several people would jump in and be like, allow me to tell you about the best podcasts of your life. Plus, they get so shoutouts at every single one of the first buckets who’ve just been amazing. Are being a little street team, even though we’re all Endo’s. So shout out to you guys. Thank you very much."
4,Thirsting in Place,59,"Yes. Thank you all so much. We really appreciate it. And we say all that to let you know that we’re not going to have any droplets. This episode, the show is still going to be good because we’re always going to give you the best that we have. But this particular episode, you know, we’re going to get in and get out and."
4,Thirsting in Place,55,"So, yes, a Pulitzer. Apologies that troubles are not going to be on the menu this week. However, we will be back next week stronger and better than ever. But this week, we do have some really remarkable stuff because we once again reached out to our glorious nurse buckets. And it felt odd for us not to address what is going on in the world in the actual episode. So we are looking at this as a sort of thought first experiment."
4,Thirsting in Place,60,"Yeah, I see how I preemptively said thank you because I knew you were going to be impressed. Nicole, thanks. Deserve it. Thank you. It’s like won’t be upset, like. So you’ll be OK? Yes. Thank you. Exactly what I see. The magic is still there."
4,Thirsting in Place,61,"So many good, so many good quarantine bays here that, you know, we can’t play all of them. But the ones that we are going to play. They just they hit the spot just right. And, you know, maybe we’ll save the rest for another episode. Who knows? But we’re going to highlight a few in this episode. And they are so funny and sweet and charming. I love them all. I’m excited to get into it. You ready, Nicole? I’m ready. Let’s go."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",62,"Hi there. Hi. I wonder what that redacted was about because it wasn’t our usual redacted, was it? No, it was not. I think our listeners are clever enough to read between the lines, between the title of this episode and and that redacted that maybe we are saying farewell. Oh, my God, Nicole. Oh, my God. Oh, man. This is the second time in as many years that we are saying goodbye. Oh, my God."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",63,"This is the end, I think we have to fight it between us, the two of us, that we need to first aid kit as a weekly podcast. Yes, right."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",64,"What a beautiful pushing over to the next. You know what, though? Nicole, you’re not wrong. I do think it’s important for us to stress that this is our decision. We have sat down, we have crunched the numbers, such as they are essentially we basically sat on a family done. I want to get wood on farm. And and then we had like a slightly more in-depth conversation about this."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",65,"And much as we love the show, I think it’s time to just kind of, you know, shut the door in a very soft way. There are no slam doors. This is the good wife. No one is sliding some shit on someone’s desk. No, it’s a very genteel operation. But it’s time for us to kind of draw a veil over this particular part of the life of first aid kit."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",64,There was no iteration of coloration in this Doonesbury. Everyone was just having a good time.
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",64,"Modest. You’re completely correct. We crushed it every fuckin week. I mean some people crushed it more than others. Let’s be very fair. But I also think I’m just saying, like, there’s no point even just like like we know. But I do I do want to stress, like Nicole said, and I want to stress what she has already stressed. This is on our own terms. This this iteration of first aid kit is an identity is closed, but we are still very much out there, out here even. And if there are opportunities for us to do stuff, live shows of frickin live tour, maybe all that other stuff that we can kind of take the time to gather and do something, we definitely are 100 percent open to that. We want to be on the road again. I miss movie nights. I love interacting with those buckets who come out. I mean, people have been in tears of, like, joy and camaraderie."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",66,"I don’t want to put myself as some kind of doctor on the frontier, but I do want to say we’re out here changing lives for like, sure, I haven’t done a heart transplant, but I have done many a third transplant and I am very pleased with our record."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",67,"Yes. Thank you to all of our listeners. Everyone who reviewed us, wrote about our episodes, know four different places online. It has been it has been a journey. You know, we did not invent desire. We did not invent left. We did not invent women expressing desire or lust. But we definitely helped shape the language around it, current day language around it. And, you know, we don’t want to say that we were the first people here. But, you know, there have been a lot of people who have been horny on main, shall we say. Yes. But we were able like themselves to put it in in a particular accessible way, I think. And that is part of our success because we have so many different people from all different walks of life talking to us about how the show has affected them, which we love to hear. We really appreciate that. Whether you are someone who is trying to relearn how to express yourself after, you know, some tragedy or you’re just someone who just never had the chance and never thought that you could say these things. We’re glad that we were here for you and we hope that you have taken whatever you learn from us and that you keep expanding your vocabulary."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",67,"We asked on Twitter if there were any redacted that you wanted us to reveal. And as all our listeners know, the redacts are what we begin each episode with and we bleep out certain words. And actually, you know, they’re actually very innocent and sweet."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",64,"Yes, exactly. This is definitely something that people it’s been weird to see people kind of misunderstand, in a way, what the redacted segment at the top of the show is. It’s not erotic fiction, as we have seen in a couple of otherwise very lovely and accurate reviews. It is a sort of game. We can’t we’re not going to use the name of the copyrighted game. That was definitely an inspiration for us. But it is a case of fill in the blanks. And like Nicole said, they are very often sweet, almost always deeply silly. And the beep is always the place where you get to, you know, like Craig David sang Fill Me In, you get to go on in and, you know, make it what you want it to be. And I have to say, a lot of you are really filthy because Nicolina out here writing sweet little odes to our faves. Ah, you’re out there imagining some dirt."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",62,"Yep. I’ve never been so repulsed and delighted. While you read a redacted in the whole history of the show. It’s a pimple. Yes. But you know that it’s also a part of intimacy, right? Like I didn’t say it wasn’t intimate because I said it was disgusting. I mean, you know, take it is terrible for you. Let me put this pimple on your back. Is that what they’re calling it now? Yes. Let me bust this pimple on your back. Hope you have what? You have another one, right? I do. I do."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",62,Don’t be modest. I did. She said yes.
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",62,"OK, that’s it. I mean, I don’t know. I’m thinking about legally changing my name to bim toot toot. I mean, because honestly, all we do is win."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",66,"Like I mean, you ask the amazing question of like, sir, do you wax or do you shave? And he was like wax, you know? And I was like, this is the DL. You don’t get any other."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",63,"We appreciate that. But also, how do you feel about all of this work that you’re doing to your body and the ways people’s perceptions of you change with that? Right, right. Men don’t get asked that. So we ask those questions and you can see them just kind of being like, huh? And they will tell us. They will say no one’s ever asked me that before"
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",64,"Like that was always the thing that I would always kind of tick off the minute someone in an interview says, oh, I’ve never been asked that before. And I’m like, well, welcome, you’re in. You’re breathing in rarified air right now."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",67,"So, yeah, because we also try to make sure that we ask our guests, our celebrity guests, when are you going to put some black women in your movies and TV shows leading roles? Because some of them did have the clout to do that, you know, to make to make some recommendations about who they wanted. And, you know, it’s interesting. This isn’t a gift that we had, although we tried our best to make it happen. But we did an episode about Jake Gyllenhaal. And as we were trying to make some things happen, his people let us know that they had listened to the episode and listened to our critique of him because he talks a good game and he is very you know, he seems to be a feminist. Right. But a lot of the work that he had done was not with a woman director. It was not with a female director. And, you know, his people let us know."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",63,"One of the things that happens a little later in life is doing the show. Someone, you know, was kind of like, you know, be careful when you’re interviewing some, you know, these guys. Make sure that you remember that they’re married or whatever. Don’t get too thirsty, so that that bothered me because we have always been professional, even as we joke with these people and Wilson Bethel was joking with us, and when he did the way Cancela voice, I was like, OK, stop playing it. You know, I gave it a little back to him. But also I was in the middle of asking him a question and I wanted to stay on task with my question and, you know, keep it as professional as possible, even as we stay jokey and funny and silly and whatever. And there has never been anything inappropriate. Like, we don’t really need to say this, but I feel like I’m just going to say it anyway. There’s never been anything inappropriate."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",66,"I don’t think we need to. But bearing in mind some of the replies is like, first of all, who do you think we are? Like, this isn’t a movie, this is real life. Like we are doing a job. It’s a very fun job. And it is for sure entertaining for you to listen to and for us to conduct. But yes, we were always doing a job and I don’t know if I remember seeing those messages are kind of being like, huh, I don’t know why you would would you do this with and again, not to make this Essentialists, but I was like, would you ask a man like, what? What am I doing here? What is this? What do you want to flirt with this person and a feeling away? So you’re projecting? I don’t know. But like Nicole said, we always turned up, did a great job."
4,"Good Night, and Good Thirst",64,"And the result is always in the fun tone. You can hear in the interviews. Everybody is relaxed and able to give really thoughtful, smart, engaged answers because they are having a good time. And I think there is no better situation to ask tough questions about something so personal and so intrinsic that is in humanity than when everybody’s kind of laughing. And, you know, we’ve lubricated the conversation with banter and like, chill laughs. And the door then opens a little bit wider. People are able to kind of give more of themselves. So I always love having people in house or on the phone or via computer or whatever, because I love the transition from them being a little bit, you know, stiff at the beginning of an interview."
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,68,The firm tug it’s a little tight. I said and the slight gasp. His eyes gleamed when he replied. It’s perfect. Is it. It is you know.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,69,I’m so ready to get into this episode so am I. Let me tell you something. He came into the studio your eyebrow was already up. I knew something was going to be good today. Like you said this is a very special week.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,70,YEAH CAUSE SOME STUFF IS HAPPENING. Yeah. The subjects the subjects. Yeah. Floor one. Yep. Huh. Of this week have been on a long term roster. We’ve been trying to figure out how to cover it so it makes sense right. And today it makes sense. It makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,71,First object. Yes we are talking about the Jasons expound on that please Nicole. We got Jason Sudeikis to listen and Jason Mizuki.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,70,Yeah I don’t want to do any of that I want to do a little bit more. But I was being very very genteel. Yes I appreciate you. It’s called a news letter with air quotes. No I have such strong feelings for both the Jasons. Yeah. Both my comedy Jason. Yeah they invoke something in me that is slightly out of the norm of my first right.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,72,This is the very first time in my life. I. Yeah. The doors and the doors are wide open and I just I just want to welcome in all the guests. Yeah.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,71,Let’s get into them. All right. Let’s do it. OK shall we start with first. I want to start with Sudeikis. Yes yes. I’m sure I saw him before Saturday Night Live. I’m I don’t know but I think it is the red tracksuit from the What’s Up With That sketch that really you know I’m looking at him dancing. And again you know the bar is pretty low for a white man to be on beat. Listen. But he was on beat.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,73,Sometimes in that tracksuit there were names that were moving to the beat along with him in those pants. And I was like yeah see. I see you. I woke up this morning a man that got out of bed. To head on down to. Look up. To a. Man. That. I think in half. Way going back to school with.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,69,And I was just like oh he’s he’s a problem. He’s somebody that I need to have in my life. Some kind of way. I. Also like you I cannot remember seeing him in a lot of things before as. He’s very regular life. He’s not like and this is no shade to Mr. Sudeikis. It was lovely but like he’s not the kind of person that you see him on the street. Are you like do a double take. What was that. He’s very normal he’s very regular looking. He looks like literally 500 other men on any given day of the week.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,70,But there’s something about his energy on original energy. Yeah something about him that you think a meal you would have a really fun time like I think is a kind of fuzziness take you on an adventure date like he’d be you know he’d be like Why don’t you just make sure you have your passports and grab a coat put on a hat even I guess. And then it would be the best day of your life. Like he would take you on some ridiculous whatever what you didn’t. Well going apple picking that we’re going to go to blubber but we’re gonna fly a rocket to the moon. All right Jason I guess he has that energy of someone who is. I use this word very very sparingly but I believe it in his case he’s impish.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,71,Yes yes. And it gets right to the edge of frat boy. Yes. Brianna I do not travel to be monsters right. You just play there and then he turns into the grown man. It’s just something is something there. And I always knew from that down red tracksuits I always knew that he had it. He was working with something. Right. You know not just on a physical like his attributes. Yeah but his ability to read your body. Yeah I think he’s the kind of person who is taking mental notes the whole time. Yes. The whole time. That’s that’s what works with his comedy and his ability to add prop and like move the scene because he will let other people be super ridiculous. The one that’s like all the Kramer energy you know whatever and he is not necessarily the straight person but he is the one that’s like I’m going to keep it you know calm even keel. Yeah. Yeah but that calm even coolness is funny as hell and we’ll have you on the floor. Right. I just love him. I love that he brings these you know levels to his comedy and he knows how to respond and react to other people in whatever he’s doing.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,74,And then you see it he expresses the thoughts so clearly you like I have no doubt what your intention is for this bit of comedy and that’s what it is he’s such a he does so much of the work inside but his face for me is incredibly mobile. He doesn’t thing where he kind of twists his mouth. He doesn’t try very very well. Yes he has quite a wry face to begin with like almost like listen I know what I look like. Yeah I know that I’m you know average whatever.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,70,He’s a man. Yeah. I feel like he was a man when he was seven. Like he had the face of a man who has had that face for literally decades. So like he again that keen understanding of what I can do and what I can do well. He plays befuddled really well. Yes. Which is why he plays an excellent Joe Biden. Yeah. On SNL. Yes. Just kind of like this man who’s kind of got too many limbs and he’s kind of flailing a little bit and is just a little bit useless but he’s charming and he’s got a rough and ready charm. So it’s kind of like right. So yeah. So there’s SNL work right.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,71,SNL work and then he started doing movies and again he was you know it took a while for him to get to the point where he was the leading man in a in a movie show. He played lots of best friend. Yeah. I think playing those best friend roles those were a way for him to just kind of build up his filmography build up his career so that once he did get to leading master status he had earned it. But I think Jason Sudeikis took his time learned when he needed to do learn what he needed to learn rather and just kind of went from there.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,74,And so it gave him time. So whether it was by his design or by casting directors or whatever. I’m glad of it because I do think like you said it allowed him to kind of just like feel his way figure out what he wanted to do an you know of course he’s done a lot of comedy. But I also like that because of that he’s also kind of edged out a little bit he’s kind of he’s kind of expanded his his his palate. Yes it waste painting with all the colors of the wind.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,74,So I was already interested as I was. Allison Aubrey who I had much enjoyed on community I thought this is a woman with excellent comedy children and I saw Jason Sudeikis and that was when I was like squirt. Hold on. Yeah. Because Jason Sudeikis in a rom com actually it turns out is one of those dreams I had had. Yeah but hadn’t articulated.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,71,What does insight into Nicole’s psyche which is basically what he was playing in this movie this you know he was someone that when we when the movie first starts it’s a flashback scene to when these two characters meet in college and you know he’s not really a ladies man you know so to speak he’s you know virginal he doesn’t know what’s going on how he’s going to get girls or whatever but then will we see him as an adult. And he is trying to run game on a lot of people a lot of people.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,75,Oh right. Okay. Yeah. So the team has Gauthier all. Right. She’s black. And white. Just stop. Does the story end with you’re doing something super racist. Oh my God no. She told me she’s black. I don’t know. I’m just trying to give you a mental picture. That’s all. OK. Racist. Keep going. OK. Will we go see a movie. During the day and she’s super smart and cool and also gorgeous. But I do what we talked about. I do not sleep. I wait four days and I call her and we go out again. All right. No sex I mean we hook up and I don’t like finger. Awesome. So I call last night. Well and then she’s like hey what are you doing.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,70,But really. But really for me it’s the way he just like go stock still. Yes. The full locusts. That is the fact that he is holding the mike to his mouth because he’s like I want you to hear everything that I’m about to say don’t listen to the sounds around me like anybody got as high as focus on what my lips are doing. Yes. I was just like That’s nice. Like a really articulate just gonna. That’s a great. It’s it’s very moving. He’s very. And the thing is he’s very good in this film.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,74,Nicole I appreciate that. He’s he’s got this energy about him. When we spoke about this when we were talking in the hot priests episode where we kind of just nailed this feeling of just when someone has an almost almost tangible crackle about them like he just does so much with so little words.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,70,However I don’t I don’t know who wrote that little bit but Jason Sudeikis is delivery of saying Don Cheadle on a bed of rice. He has no one been around some Caribbean black women. The. Peak observation. So shall I see you Jason with your terrible Jamaican accent. Well we’re grateful that you exists in this universe and I’m making comedy and also not comedy. I’m doing amazing sweetie. OK.
4,Jason. And Jason Again.,71,So he was so strange just a strange super strange just weird and wild.
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,76,"If you thought you were a wolf born in the human body, you were Wolf kid, but you could be a focus or a money tree or Harry Potter yourself."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,77,"Well, as per usual, I’m thinking about how everything is Tumblr now and has been since at least 2013 Tumblr, the blogging platform that most people know for banning porn in like twenty eighteen, but which kind of may have raised me. I’m so glad"
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"we’re finally doing this episode because you make this statement multiple times a day. And from now on I’m going to have like a swear jar for it. But it’s going to be you’ve been showing me a dollar every time you say that everything is Tumblr. Now, I"
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"Too late. On today’s episode, we’re going to draw a line from the early 2010s era of Tumblr that Rachel is so obsessed with straight through to the way that people talk and behave on the modern day Internet. We’re going to hear an exclusive interview with Zeon Berry, who’s now an online community builder and writer. But for a certain era of Tumblr user, again, Rachel, he’s probably best known as the creator and moderator of a blog called This is White Privilege. He’ll talk about the blogs complicated legacy and what ultimately led him to step away from it. But first, we’ve got a couple of high speed downloads to catch you up on, some absolute online nonsense from the last few days."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,77,"In case you somehow missed it, high speed download is a game we play in which we have exactly 60 seconds to explain something that happened on the Internet in the past week. Before we get started, I would like to say that if you are a person who hates listening to people speak really fast, I would highly recommend putting your podcast playback settings on point five speed, because we’re about to speak really, really, really fast. Madison, what are you going to be telling me about this week?"
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"Rachel, I’m going to be telling you about another Rachel who has sullied the Rachel. I’m talking specifically about girl by self-help guru Gross Rachel Hollis, who got into some hot water this week and then just proceeded to turn up the burner under the hot water she was in. What is it about me that made you think I want to be relatable?"
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"Rachel Hollis is an event planner, turned influencer, best selling author, girl, best motivational speaker all around. Yes, Queen. Queen, she is a mother of four, was married to a former Disney actor, girl, boss, wife, guy. They have since divorced short of a girl wash her face, which Drew Barrymore and Reese Witherspoon obviously all endorsed. I cannot overstate to you how many people bought this fucking book. Typical self-help. Go get your goals, girl. Stay motivated. Super toxic positivity does not account for any structural challenges that women, especially, you know, women of color face in actualizing those goals. Go figure. She was once accused of plagiarizing Maya Angelou and taking credit for the Still I Rise quote on Instagram. This week, she posted a video responding to someone who called her out for being privileged and not relatable for having a housekeeper."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"In response video on Instagram, where Rachel has one point seven million yikes followers, she said she hires, quote, a sweet woman who comes to her house twice a week to, quote, clean the toilets. He got to hear the way she says, clean my toilets. It’s weird and demeaning and like it just just say you have a housekeeper. That’s OK. You’re right. And second, housekeepers, that she works really, really hard to be a girl boss and doesn’t want to be relatable. OK, girl, your whole spiel is being relatable. Face Wash is relatable. It’s soap. In the caption, she lists the names of other quote unquote, not relatable woman women. That was phenomenal. Thank you. I feel really good about that. But unfortunately, I was just about to get to the thing that I know is going to send you through the roof. Are you in a position to receive information that might hurt you?"
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,77,I kind of want to take away the rule where you get another sentence because I feel like I don’t want to hear this. But you get one more sentence to tell me what’s wrong.
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,77,"you don’t call Kardashian is where the fuck have you been? But also she is a influencers member of the Kardashian junior squad, which again, if you know who they are, how do I get where you are? But this weekend she authorized photo of her appeared on the Internet, which means that it was unedited and it was apparently uploaded by some unwitting assistant, which, like IP, that is, this is career and shows her in a bikini. And let’s be clear, she looks great, but it’s really not like the plastic CGI smoothness that like all the Kardashian photos, they’re really good. And if you think the devil works hard, Kris Jenner works motherfucking harder because she worked, like, so quickly to get this photo taken off the Internet. Like anywhere you try to find this photo like photo, it’s like copyright claims. And so, as I thought it was getting scrubbed from the Internet, we’re just a controversy by doing Instagram live in a about bathroom, showing off our best angles, which is like really sad for like five reasons. One, like she looked great in the first photo. It just wasn’t edited."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,77,"Deciding something on the Internet is really hard. And they’re like the Kardashians created the weird, like we touch Seiberg Flatmate’s Instagram culture that we now live on."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,77,"I mean, I cannot state strongly enough that the Kardashian clan is like not solely responsible, but has played a huge part in the unrealistic standards of bodies on Instagram. And it is like deeply wild to me that there is not a single second of, like, introspection in that caption."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"In case anyone is not familiar. And honestly, I’m so happy for you. Stop listening now. A revenge body is like when you get really shredded and hot and lose a lot of weight to, like, make your ex jealous that they’re your ex."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,"Is not the there’s just like such an extreme sense of schadenfreude, of seeing this person who like has contributed to a culture that has made me as a woman feel so shit about my body being like I feel really bad about my body. Why are people respecting that? That photo would have gloss passed my eyeballs and I wouldn’t have like that."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,79,"Oh, OK. So I first joined Tumblr and now the year of our Lord 2010. Who I was. Yeah, I was in my college dorm room with my my roommate Michael SRAM. We were doing homework and he just turned to me and he was like, you know what, we should get tumblers. And I was like, why? And it’s like, you know, because I think it’s really good for musicians and it’s really like artsy and stuff like that. So we should get temblors. And I was like, OK, so I signed up for my Tumblr in 2010 and yeah, that’s kind of how it started."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,79,"Yeah. So I guess it really starts with, you know, when I signed up in 2010, I was just starting to get into socialism as a concept. So that was just what I was putting on my Tumblr. And then that’s kind of where the followers started to come in. I will say at the beginning it was fragmented. Right? There was a socialist Tumblr, there was a feminist Tumblr, there was a black people Tumblr with all these all these different little political sub pockets that were going on that eventually converged into one big thing that turned into what we would all call Tumblr discourse."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,79,"I remember that night was Tyler, the creator, winning and being, and that caused a big argument and that’s the very first big political argument I ever remember on Tumblr, because the discussion was, Tyler, the creator is homophobic. Oh, he’s also a misogynist, but he’s pro black. But you can’t judge black people for what they create to get out of poverty. So it was like a big thing that was going on. And that’s when I first started to use that term white privilege or when I first heard the term white privilege. And that’s kind of what prompted me to start. This is white privilege, which was the Tumblr blog that I moderated."
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,78,dán for maybe some of our listeners who weren’t online in in the era that was Tumblr. Could you describe like a quintessential this is white privilege post or your your platonic ideal of this is white privilege post?
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,79,So I think it burnt out in the sense that I became interested in other things. I heard someone describe Tumblr once since the abandoned clown factory on the other side of the Internet.
5,Everything Is Tumblr Now,79,"Part of it is like I had an urge to make make it transactional. I had the urge to make it into a website or to publish it into a book or something along those lines. But I think the ambivalence really comes from I don’t like dumbing down the conversation. I think that when I was 20 or 22, I felt like I knew everything and I felt like it was so simple and it was so black and white and so easy to understand. And that if you disagree with me, that means you hate black people. And if you don’t like the way I run the blog, it means that you’re just a racist period. And I was just so full of, like vinegar and anger. And I just don’t think that reflects the way I feel now. At 31, I feel a lot different about how to express some of that stuff than at twenty one. If I ever had to go back there and read probably some of the ways I spoke to people on that blog, I. I’ll probably be embarrassed, I probably want to go back and apologize to them."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,80,"Yeah, it is from a user whose handle is at Girl Mode and the tweet is, yeah I have NFTE. Nice fucking tits matterson. I bet you actually good. No I’m not. This is the last we’re going to talk about NFTE on the podcast. That’s probably a lie. And I reserve the right to change my mind, but you should know what they are. But OK, I just it was a really good tweet but we’re not actually talking about NFTE today. We’re going to talk about vaccines and all the ways that Instagram is built to convince you to shop and all the weird shit it convinced us me you to buy in. The last year while we were stuck at home, I sort of like to think of Instagram as QVC on my phone."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,81,"It’s QVC, but with an algorithm that knows exactly what to serve you. But before we get into the stuff that I actually want to buy, we’re going to get into some stuff that I wish didn’t exist on the Internet at all. There’s been a recent wave of vaccine means that has apparently convinced somebody somewhere with access to Etsy that what we really need right now are a crossover of Hogwarts content and vaccine meme content. And by content, I mean t shirts that you can buy to put on your actual physical body."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,81,"No, I’m burning it. But if there’s anything the Internet is really good at besides giving medicine things to buy me that I don’t want, it’s convincing people that doing free spanton for major corporations is a personality. And the corporation talking about this week are pharmaceutical companies."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,80,"If you’re not familiar with the sort of personalities the vaccines have developed online, Pfizer is the hot girl vaccine. Moderna is the Dolly Parton shot. And then there’s the redheaded stepchild, the J and J. One shot vaccine."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,81,"If you’ve been online or watching cable news, you might have heard that the use of Johnson and Johnson vaccine has actually been put on pause in the United States this week. Regulators are further investigating adverse effects of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which, to be clear thus far appear to be very, very rare."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,80,"Right. The numbers right now are about one in a million. And experts across the board are saying the benefits of protecting yourself against the ravages of covid far outweigh these potential adverse side effects. I got to say, though, isn’t it so fun to watch people around the world suddenly get very concerned about women getting blood clots from necessary medication?"
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,81,It’s been it’s been so fun. I couldn’t think of any other medication that might cause these kind of adverse effects that could also use this attention. No other medication
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,80,at birth control doesn’t exist. But these sorts of discussions require a kind of nuance that you don’t necessarily get in Meems or on.
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,80,"so what we’re describing here is the meme fixation of vaccines. But something else that has arisen is the question of whether or not these vaccine personality bits and jokes, whether or not they’re actually harming the vaccine effort. You know, it’s all fun and games until no one gets a shot. The concept of herd immunity feels so tangible and close, or at least like closer than it did even six months ago. I I was thinking about that the other night. I was lying in bed watching tick tock. And I came across this this tick tock that a. It made me laugh and then started to kind of make me angry. I’m like 95 percent effective. So am I. We’re both Amarone, so we’re basically the same. No, we’re not. You’re so high maintenance or to be stored at like negative 70 degrees Celsius, I can be stored at room temperature. Johnson This tick tock is a comedian who is cause playing as all of the different vaccines and she’s having a conversation between them. And every time she switches between a character, she changes clothes and pins a different index card with the vaccine named to her chest. So there’s like a green index card in a green T-shirt. When she’s Fizer and when she’s Moderna, she’s in yellow."
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,81,"Yeah, it feels kind of inescapable at this point. I’ve seen this one, which is significant, actually seemingly worse than the one that you just showed us. And there wasn’t even a moment where I was like, ha ha, that’s funny. I was just immediately like, why are we doing this?"
5,A Vaccine Is Not a Personality,81,"OK, so it’s kind of this club skit, which is actually the format that I’ve seen most often, like it’s this club bouncer and they’re allowing people in and it’s like, here’s the Johnson and Johnson vaccine."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,82,"Yeah, I know we have like a whole entire actual episode planned out for today, but the only thing I want to talk about is this tick tock. Who’s going to tell the details that their main character is a fruit?"
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,83,"I hate to break this to you, but nothing to vegetable vegetables just term. That means you can eat it in Bodney. Nothing’s a vegetable."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,84,"It’s this woman saying who’s going to tell vegetables that their lead character is a fruit? And then another woman comes in. That’s the second voice you hear and says, hold up, vegetables aren’t real. And here is why."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,85,"Tuber and also on the screen is this man who is laughing at the original TIKAI,"
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,85,"You so often hear these like Twitter means where it’s like you’re making the tomatoes in your salad. And like you, you intuitively know that carrots and potatoes are like root vegetables."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,84,"Sorry, I walk into to Bath and Body Works as a teenager in my hometown mall and a cucumber salad, body spray, melon, melon, body spray."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,85,"Better than honestly, the sweet pea, which kind of gives me more flashbacks."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,84,"Like yeah. Or like what. I thought sex. You know, I shouldn’t finish this. That is enough about vegetables today. We’ve actually got to tell you that if you’re still using reaction gifs, you may or may not be revealing how old you are."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,85,"Yeah, the latest battle in a long running war between generations has claimed a new victim, friend of the pod, Jenny Zhang, who writes for Eater and last week tweeted that she can always tell that someone’s over the age of 33 if they consistently use reply gifts, which I laughed at."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,85,"Twitter never knows how to move along. They could take a note from the all-American Rejects song Move Along. But unfortunately, they have all latched on to this idea that the girls are fighting the girls being the generations, specifically GenZE and millennials. But it’s mostly just millennials realizing that they’re aging."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,84,"Yeah, I the Mirror is revealing it to me. Every day later in the show, we’re actually going to hear from Jenny about how this innocuous tweet took an ugly turn, blew up her feed. But first, Rachel and I are going to take you back and we’re going to trace the history of this generational war, which isn’t really much of a war at all. How how would you describe it, Rachel?"
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,83,"I’m black, skinny jeans and my Sipah. I use this emoji and I like the heart. So you think we’re old? Well, I have a map. We give you Wi-Fi and we could take it back. Remember last year you bought mom jeans and then you’re out here making side part Meems. Oh, that’s cute. We may not be teens, but just remember, we’re the old queens."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,83,"The GenZE, you can suck it can’t tell me what to wear. Because I’ve been rocking this sad since you had Kermit on your underwear, so cute and you can try these skinny jeans from my cold dead"
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,85,"what kind of brings all of these things together besides the fact that they’re all kind of dumb is that it’s really petty and very cranky, but it’s ultimately not that deep. And in a way, it’s karma for all the boomer beloved industries that millennials killed, which includes everything from napkins to top sheets."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,82,"I think I’ve had like some version of this thought or observation, like since people started making a big deal about like the generational, I don’t know, gaps and like wars and stuff. But I think I did see some reaction GIFs maybe to some some people I follow or something who are definitely like kind of in the older millennial realm, I would say. But it wasn’t even like a specific incident that set me off so much. I was like, oh, yeah, that’s that’s still going on. So time to kind of put this on the world and see what happens."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,82,"I mean, I don’t think anyone really expects or knows or can predict unless they had, like, a huge following themselves and are used to this, but if you’re like just a regular Anami account like mine, you never really know what’s going to happen once you throw this garbage out into the world. And this time the world received it with open arms and also like with some pitchforks."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,82,"um. Let’s see. Dr. Cornbread says I’m seventy seven on Twitter often and can’t imagine getting worked up over this. I don’t know if that’s like. Dr. Coimbra, coming for me or coming from applies unclear, but thank you, Dr. Conrad Schissel. Unlike you and me, those old dinosaurs are whack. Let’s see, after seeing three successive youngin age groups, Tosa, smug comments like this over the years, only to quickly find themselves labeled old by the next bunch, I’m feeling pretty Zen about being almost double thirty three sixty six using Twitter. That’s that’s great."
5,Every Generation Has Its Cringe,82,"Oh I’m glad he, he got it. So yeah. That like brought out a whole level of like generational fighting and aggression towards each other, especially since like boomers sort of got the sort of political views sort of transplanted onto it. People are seeing some kind of like moral values or like virtue attached to these things in ways that it was easier to kind of ignore back when people weren’t is online. Now, it’s like part of your online persona and like how you use social media as well."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,86,"I know how to use Twitter. Please listen to this Internet culture podcast. Yeah, I did. OK, it was a mistake. I thought I was replying to someone and instead I just contextless tweeted No."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,"Oh, yeah, welcome dissy. Why am I where at least one of us understand how Twitter works? But today we’re not going to be talking about Twitter for like once in our lives. We’re going to be talking about the latest controversy on a different platform. Tick tock. So, Addison, Ray Easterling is a white tick tock star who has a whopping 79 million followers, a burgeoning pop career and a starring role in a forthcoming reboot of She’s All That because clearly we cannot make a movie that is not a superhero movie or a reboot in 2021."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,"last week, she performed a dance, The Khateeb Up, which is the current number one song on the country and an absolute Bangar, if you haven’t heard it at the up"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,"but the thing is, it’s not actually her dance. It’s true. Creators are two black Texas teenagers who were just sitting in class when they learned what to take talks. Very biggest stars had gone viral with something that they had created"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,86,"in the segment. Jimmy Fallon is standing on stage holding a giant cue cards with the names of various TIC dances written on them, while his house band The Roots plays covers of each dances corresponding songs. And when each song plays, Addison begins a new dance, including the up dance. If you are having deja vu hearing this, that’s because this quite literally has happened before, a little over a year ago, Tacs actual biggest star, because believe it or not, having how many followers did you say she had? 79 million. Having seventy nine million followers does not make you the most followed person on the platform. Charlie DeMello, Tic Tacs biggest star, came under fire for popularizing the renegade dance without ever crediting its creator, a black Atlanta teenager named Julia Harmon. Julia only got credit after an online uproar, which is exactly what’s happening now to Maya Johnson and Chris Cotter, the two kids behind the up dance."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,86,"the side by side video. If you listener have not seen the side by side video, we will put it in the show notes because we’re going to do our best to describe it. But honestly,"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,"you got to see it. So on the right side, you see Addison Ray with Jimmy Fallon kind of bopping offstage, doing what Jimmy Fallon does, doing this dance. And then on the left, you see Maya and Chris doing this dance with significantly more talent, energy, commitment, any number of synonyms here that just describe the fact that they’re doing this dance so much better than her. The sidebar is created by a Twitter user whose handle is accurate. Underscore Janelle. And can I just say that you you’ve done a public service, Carol."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,86,"We thank you. Also carries video has been viewed 16 million times. But obviously the way the Internet works, everybody steals everything, which is why we’re here today, frankly. So like so many people have seen this this comparison video at this point."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,But the general plot is that these white cheerleaders are gaining championship titles by stealing the routines of black cheerleaders.
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"Yes. So we first made this dance about a month and a half ago, and we just knew that we were going to link the next day. So we seeing our rooms on face time and we we’re big fans of Cardi B, so and her song was popping at the time. So like, hey, we should totally like first figure out which part of the song we’re going to use and we just like we like the beat and everything. So me and Chris came up with our own dance moves and we put them together and we created that one dance. And then we linked up in downtown Houston and we just made it happen. I know that’s"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,89,"Yeah. And then we both just like kind of did our own thing from there. And then once we came back to each other with our own things, we kind of just combine them together and we saw how they worked with each other. And then we we lost the I think the hardest part about it was probably the two beats. We’re like we had to, like, jump in touch because I was like, yeah,"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,86,"the jump and touch being the part where you jump from the ground, bring your knees up to your chest and touch your elbows to your knees like I like broken ankle. Just describing that. Yeah. When did you notice the challenge was starting to go viral on Ticktock?"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"I feel like we’ve got a lot of people to share our posts. When we first post today, we posted on all platforms. I know Khateeb has reissued our challenge twice on her story on Instagram and she posted it on her. So that has helped a lot. And then I just think, like our challenges is really good. Everybody wants to do these people. That’s younger, even adults. I like teachers. Everybody’s doing a challenge. This is crazy."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,89,"Oh, we were excited. I remember I was lying in my bed and my have based on me and she’s like, Chris, Chris, Chris, can’t you just toss it up on Instagram? And I was like, no way. So then I went to go check it out. And then she actually did ended up and posted this on Instagram. And I was talking about it to all of my friends, just I saw her friends and I was just like everyone was excited and it was crazy."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,86,"So obviously, your dance challenge blew up this week for a totally different reason. Aside from it just being excellent. When did you first find out about Addison Rae performing your dance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon?"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"I don’t know, because I forgot how long maybe two days ago. I don’t know. Maybe the exact day that she performed, people were tagging me on my Instagram like, dang my your challenge is really, really that big. Like it’s on TV. People are telling me. And I’m like, wow. So my first response was like, dang, like, that’s crazy. Like I’m happy and like I’m like, she’s really doing awesome that we came up with. But then when you sit down and think about it, it’s like everybody’s time is going to come. I start to like feel like it should have been our time to do that. And even the other dancers that she has before that we should have went up and performed our own dance. I just felt like for us that would have been our time to shine and all the other dancers, too. I’m pretty sure that the creators of those dances would have wanted the same."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,89,"I was actually in school and I remember Maya had severe posts and it was like the main post everyone was talking about. And it was like whenever they put me in Maya’s video next to the video of Addison actually doing the dance. And I saw it and I looked at the comments and like I was just like amazed that she went on national television and actually did our dance. And then it was like I felt so bad at the same time because she was getting a lot of backlash. And I feel as if she shouldn’t have got that much backlash because I feel I could be hard to discredit somebody like in the middle of a show. So it was like I was happy. But at the same time, I didn’t want one. I didn’t want me and might be going up while. She was getting brought down."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,"It’s not just about the credit, though, I mean, obviously the credit in terms of like Addison, it would have been hard, I guess, for Jimmy Fallon to have. I don’t I mean, I don’t know. And some people wouldn’t"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"Not only that, but Ed is saying she’s a big she plays a big role on six o’clock. People look up to her and of course, people know who created the challenge. I mean, like part of you supposed to be is going crazy."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,87,"I mean, I think what a lot of people who aren’t I think that understand is that it also translates to like money. Right? Like partnerships and sponsorships. And so, I mean, we can’t really talk about the kind of dynamics of this happening without talking about the racial dynamics on ticktock where which are the racial dynamics of America, where black creators are creating, like, amazing content that goes viral with like a largely white face. And so I’m curious as to how you’ll feel about that, having a been on to talk for like years at this point, kind of seeing this cycle go every few years and now, like being at the center of it."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"Me and Chris, we’ve always Platonist and we’ve always seen people such as our friends, even Evangelia and the girl that made the Renegade. We personally knew her before. She’s what she blew up before we knew her before we negate. So we see the whole her credits getting stolen. And we we felt so bad, like hoping that never happens because, you know, so it’s crazy. But then on top of that, it’s like a lot of people that are not my race. They like to, you know, take our, you know, stuff and water it down. But it’s like, why not give credit to the people who make the dance? And that even leads to such things as opportunities, just like Edison. And she’s got that big opportunity when I feel like that that could have been us."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,89,"I definitely feel like it’s like much easier or the beauty standard, which is like really sad that people have set the standard to be Caucasian, blond hair, blue eyes, whatever it might be. And they go out here and they steal content from hardworking black creators like Nehemiah and they just completely. What what people like to call whitewash it. I remember whenever we saw Julia and we saw her create the Renegade and then we saw Baalen, Tick-Tock, Charlie, Emilio, Addison, all these other people that got famous or that dance, basically because everybody thought it was like their dance, because they did it all the time, never tied Julia. And we just felt like really, really bad for her. And then whenever she finally got that moment, whenever she flew out to L.A., collab with people, was performing every work on the Ellen Show, got their fight again, followers. We were so, like, happy. We were so deep. And I was actually about a year ago now, and I remember the entire time that everything was happening. We were just like praying that it didn’t happen. And now it’s like actually happening to us."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,89,"Yeah. As actually after the entire thing, she actually ended up following me on top, which is like really strange. Like I was like and took my dance and now you’re following me. I was like, I mean, I guess. And then she didn’t follow Mya. And then I was like, that’s really weird. So it was like she followed me and she contacted me and she wants to actually link up with me and Maya and like do a collab and like group dance and all of that stuff. And then same thing. What I was saying, they found each other the DNA. Yeah."
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"time, which is crazy. So we really did meet each other through online. And then we did our first we first linked in person at the outlet mall. When people see that we posted a video together, they were like, oh my God, like Chris, OMYA just really linked up and did this. Ever since that we’ve always we always do linkups"
5,What’s Really “Up” With That TikTok Dance,88,"It’s crazy. So a lot of them, they don’t really look at me as like famous. But other people, like when I go to track meets or I’m going to the mall, a lot of people come up to me and say, hey, can we take pictures? And we just Six Flags. And it was so many people that want to take pictures of me. It was crazy."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,"If you’ve been on the air at all in the past week, you might have heard about a really big boat that was stuck in a canal. It was kind of just this feat of fucking up that was so impressive. It made all of us collectively feel better about our own minor mistakes that didn’t disrupt international trade. But unfortunately, we can no longer revel in our own sense of superiority anymore because the big boat has been unstuck and international trade has continued."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,"in celebration of the big boats newfound freedom. We’re going to read a little bit of fan fiction right now. We really wanted to play my heart will go on under all of this, but unfortunately, we don’t have the rights to that song."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,91,"Well, here we go. It was with immense relief that the canal gushed under her beloveds hole whenever high tides arrived, hurrying to support the ever given before her body failed and wounded itself. She pushed and rose, lifting the heavy, large ship with the utmost tender care, smiling encouragingly at the panting painting ship, the vessel with smile right back propellers spinning tiredly and bough lifting slightly from the trench to gaze down at the waters. Moonlight danced over the rippling waters and the ever given hummed happily. You look breathtaking. Tonight, the canal glanced at the reflection, shimmering over her surface. I’m afraid it’s all you, my darling. And so it was the ever given’s thousands of lamps that shown like specks of diamonds against a ribbon of inky water."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,"I think I need a cigarette after that. I got to say, I really love fan fiction writers like they have so much fun, too. So on that note of people taking extremely creative and also smutty license, we’re going to talk about a new video from Loana. That’s more after the break."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,92,"go to your place and they in know all I you, which was hoping I could get you those smiles on my face. Oh, man, you’re leaving now."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,That’s the music video for this song by Little Nozaki already has more than 51 million views on YouTube and has managed to freak a lot of those people out.
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,"Listen, we have a pandemic. We have a satanic panic. All we need is a witch hunt and we’re in the Middle Ages again. To the uninitiated, it might be just a little bit weird to hear that the same person who gave us the earworm Old Town Road would be at the center of a right wing shitstorm that manages to involve sneakers that are decorated with pentagrams and also contain a single drop of human blood. What? Yeah, it’s biohazard, but make it fashion. I mean, for the exits, it’s really not that strange to turn at all. You could say this was all part of the master plan. He’s been playing a long game, harnessing the Internet and somehow managing at the same time to make a video where he gives Satan the lap dance into just a really poignant and hopeful message for closeted queer kids."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,"I mean, the reaction the Amazon are having is why do the reaction the Friday night Internet had people were losing their absolute shit. There were just so many like supportive tweets. There were so many tweets from, like gay kids who grew up in the church. There were just tweets from people like someone named Kaiapoi Slim who said it being quiet and chill is your thing. That’s absolutely wonderful for you. But it’s genuinely nice to see someone with ex’s recent influence getting killed by a butt plug and pull dance. And to hell, finally, a little freak representation."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,93,"Yeah, I don’t know who it was. I thought it was I was reading this morning and said, well, you know what made him famous? I say, well, you know, he was at horses, got my horses and whatever. That’s all I like. That’s got a cool beat. I’ll never listen to it again. A bunch of devil worship and wicked nonsense being a grandmother. I know you’re not getting this, you sick, sick, sick. You think I’m old for that? You lost your mind."
5,Hail Satan! It’s White Boy Summer,90,"truly a banger. But in a way, Old Town Road was a meme in and of itself. The inequality of a meme is its ability to kind of build on itself. And Old Town Road does that with just the endless amount of remixes the little ex was putting out. I don’t know if you remember that kind of like moment during the old town road rush where it felt like every other week there was a new remix. The most popular one was probably Billy Ray Cyrus, but there was Young Thug. There was Mason Ramsey, who was a meme in and of himself. Even Beats had sold Town Road Montoro call me by your name, actually kind of builds on that, like ingrained knowledge of what constitutes a meme and what constitutes reality. Leona’s I tweeted about using stills from SpongeBob, which if you have spent any time on the Internet, you know, is one of the most memorable shows in existence. And he you stills from this show as inspiration for specific scenes,"

Welcome both to Slate and the show. How long have you been at late?"
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,96,"All right, coming to America is a huge hit and something of a decade capstone for Eddie Murphy. He was a huge star in the 80s. Our younger listeners might not know is just hit after hit after hit. The 1988 original is a silly comedy about an African prince who comes to the United States and interacts with American culture, specifically black American culture. It’s now, 30 years later, Murphy’s career is on an upswing. Thanks. I think mostly to Dolemite is my name, which we all liked in this one. Prince Akeem has become a king of Zamunda, and though he has three capable young daughters, he believes he needs a male heir to the throne, only to discover, yes, that he has fathered an illegitimate child when he was stateside in the original movie. What follows is a reversal of the original film’s premise. The young son leaves the United States and comes to Africa. OK, in the clip, we listen to Eddie Murphy Zakim introducing his long lost son to his family."

And my name is Mary. How do you do? Just call me your second mom. But you really don’t have two girls. I mean, but you should though, because I kind of am. Well, look at us. Just one big happy and an American aristocratic blended family. I just like the conditions."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,98,"Oh, I mean, even as a nostalgia trip, which is really the most I was sort of hoping for from this movie, I just found it so limp and so disappointing. I, I really want to hear from Alegra, who I think more recently than you and I, Steve has watched the original coming to America and and hear what she thinks about, you know, both the timing and the quality of this. I don’t know what you’d want to call it, I guess a revisitation of that universe. But coming over 30 years later, I really would have hoped that this movie brought a more 21st century sensibility or some kind of reinvention of coming to America. Instead, it seems like it it relies on almost exactly the same very sexist tropes as the first, but which have just aged so much more poorly. I don’t know. I didn’t crack a smile the entire time. That’s all I can say."

3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,99,"One character mentions that women are not even allowed to own businesses. It’s just really regressive society that in the 21st century, it’s disappointing for many reasons, but especially in the sense that this is a portrayal of Africa. And that’s something I wrote about on Slate, is that it is disappointing and upsetting, even presentation of what Africa is like to a more ignorant American viewer base of it has, you know, these regressive ideals, but also it has a villain who is like an African warlord with child soldiers. Right. Like it really plays into these outdated tropes and beliefs about what Africa is like that also were featured in the original film. But I think watching the original, which I really love, it’s it’s somewhat easier to overlook in that that was, you know, nineteen eighty eight. And my understanding of, you know, how politically correct that era was compared to now is that it was far less so and so yeah, there were certain aspects like that that were just very disappointing and even a turn off in watching this film, despite it really, really borrowing so much from the original."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,99,"The movie meant to you and how it may be held up on a recent viewing, so I remember watching it a lot, especially because, you know, I was a kid in the late 90s and early 2000s, and Eddie Murphy was really going through a family friendly sort of reinvention of his career, you know, with Shrek and Daddy day care. So he was a he was a big deal for a lot of kids our age, my age. So, you know, watching any Eddie Murphy movie was always a treat. And I found it very funny, especially because, you know, I’m an American with an African mother. My mother is from Nigeria who she moved to America in 1980. So she’s actually lived the majority of her life at this point in the United States. But she is still very connected to her Nigerian roots. So I found it particularly funny because as a young person who didn’t have too much knowledge of Africa but had that personal connection, I was like, oh, here’s a movie about Africa, like a comedy about Africa. This is so funny, Mom. But of course, as someone who actually is from the continent, she was highly, you know, I don’t know, disturbed is the right word, but she found it really, really dumb, really offensive, I think, in terms of how it was showing Africa to Americans."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,99,"And this was a time when people really, really openly stereotyped the continent. You know, people would just continue to refer to it as if it’s some very singular country, which is absolutely not the case. Right. So in watching the sequel, are preparing to watch the sequel, that memory of my mom always being annoyed by the film when it was on, or at least my sister and I saying, hey, isn’t this funny, Mom? Did you like this movie? And her really adamantly saying no protesting that idea. You know, years later, as an adult, I wanted to watch the original before the the new one to kind of take her perspective into that viewing. And I could definitely see why it’s irritating to have this very, you know, a comic presentation of what an African royal is like. And to see that just completely repeated in the sequel, you know, watching it almost immediately after it was. Yeah, it’s it’s disappointing or upsetting and more personally frustrating now to see like, this is how the biggest one of the biggest, most bankable American black comedians is imaging Africa. Although I will say, and I mentioned this earlier of how, you know, Dana feels more negatively toward this film than I do. There is still something universally or persistently appealing about Eddie Murphy or at least his his worlds and The Arsenio Hall. You know, pairing is always kind of delightful. So I did you know, I did still find some humor, but overall, I agree. I mean, it was definitely just a very languid and not especially funny film."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,98,"You know, something else that occurred to me in the time in between the first coming to America and this one, we’ve had another. And I think you talk about this when you write about it. We’ve had another fictional African country that’s taken over, you know, a big a big part of pop cultural consciousness, which is Wauconda from the Black Panther movie. And I wonder, for one thing, I wonder what your mom thinks of what content in Black Panther and whether she responds to that differently. But it also just made me think about why Wauconda, although also obviously an amalgam of, you know, various kind of tropes about the imagination of what Africa could be, that Wauconda seems like an empowering fantasy for for viewers and for black fans of that franchise rather than, you know, seeming to shut Africa down into this, as you say, just, you know, boiling down all these stereotypes and, for example, giving everyone the same accent as if everyone in Africa speaks the same language, which is, you know, accented English. I mean, all of that stuff. You could actually say that the Black Panther movies do that to a certain extent, too, right? Because they also create an accent. But I just wonder, you know, given that we’re talking about how this franchise seems not to have reinvented itself for the 21st century, how you think Wauconda and, you know, the popularity of Black Panther fits into the way a movie like this lands?"
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,100,"A upholding Africa as a place to be amazed by and to believe in the beauty of like Wauconda is just a beautiful, beautiful country. So, yeah, I mean, seeing that and having that be now the predominant fictional African nation and a couple of years later, having the moon to come back, it really does feel like a stark and gross contrast now of, OK, you know, and Wauconda women are the best like to Tahla was whatever. But I loved all the female characters. They were the stars to me. And now we’re going to a place where women can’t even have had jobs and can’t be in charge."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,98,"And in comparing Zamunda to Wauconda and the Black Panther universe, it also just seems worth noting that that movie is also directed by a black man, Ryan Coogler, whereas both of these movies that coming to America first one was directed by John Landis, this one by Craig Brewer, both white men. Craig Brewer does have a long history directing black centered films. He made Hustle and Flow and he actually directed Dolemite Is My Name, the reason Eddie Murphy biopic that we talked about on this show and liked a lot. So I’m not trying to say that there couldn’t be a white director who could handle this material sensitively, but it just doesn’t seem like it’s on the front burner for him to try to rethink the way Africa is being shown and thought about the way it was for Ryan Coogler."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,100,"It’s especially disappointing because Ryan Coogler was part of the like executive production team on this film. So you would think he would bring that kind of perspective or oversight. But I mean, I think you kind of have to be different to Eddie Murphy in a lot of ways. You know, like I can’t imagine people who are younger than Eddie Murphy and probably really looked up to him as comics, pushing back too much. And from my understanding, like Eddie Murphy kind of didn’t even really want to do this for a while. And here’s a way to easily kind of try and recapture some some of his old Box-Office glory, although, of course, now it’s just on streaming. But it ended up having, like the biggest streaming debut of the last 12 months, which is wild, but incredible anyway."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,96,"Well, it’s coming to numeral two America. You can find it on Amazon Prime. We were pretty thumbs down on it. But if you’re looking for Alegra, you said a stark and grotesque contrast straight."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,98,"All I have is to tell our listeners who are Slate plus members, that today they’re going to get a bonus segment where we talk about post pandemic anxiety’s. It seems like we can all maybe start to see the end of this right now. You got vaccinated last week, which is a really exciting development. I love hearing that anyone got their shot. We’re going to talk, though, about anxiety’s having to do with the end of the pandemic. And I thought this would be an interesting idea because I kept on seeing on social media various people sharing, you know, what they’re what they’re dreading about the world reopening again. And we’ve sort of talked about that in reverse. We’ve talked in the past about, you know, finding silver linings in our stuck inside days."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,100,"Yeah, it’s funny because I actually saw Black Panther, you know, the weekend it came out with my mom partially at her own request. And she’s not someone who watches blockbusters and certainly not superhero films. But as an older, you know, black woman who’s lived in this country for so long and is African and identifies that way still. This was something that’s still punctuated her own, you know, cultural awareness and with something she felt very emphatically excited about and really wanted to see. So we went to see it together. And I think that was actually a powerful experience. She was very moved by it because and we did talk about this, she and I, when we talked about coming to America a bit for my piece, is that Wauconda does present this more utopian and powered country fictional. It may be, but, you know, it does have hyper intelligent people."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,100,"This all speaks to, like, how I find this interesting from a theoretical perspective. Like, I’m more intrigued by hearing you guys talk about it, but watching it was a different experience. I think, for me. I think watching it as a theoretical piece is not as fun as discussing it as such. But I am I don’t want to suggest that I’m turned off by the Almodóvar aesthetic. I think I’m just like not someone who is attracted to artifice, you know, are artifice and obvious performance in my film choices. But at the same time, I do think I’m I’m curious to see his other work, his features, especially hearing you guys rave."
3,“WFT is an NFT” Edition,100,"One question I still have about NFTE is, is the I guess the concept of, OK, this is something that only the original artist can confer upon the buyer. But I wonder if that’s actually true, because I’ve read a lot about how it actually can enable, you know, scams more more readily in that, you know, if someone is creating an NFTE of an artist’s tweet, persay, then they’re essentially selling that artist’s art attached to that tweet. Right. And then the artists themselves, if it’s someone else selling that NFTE isn’t actually making any profit off of the sale. So how how big of an issue is that actually in this sort of burgeoning and Ifti market?"
