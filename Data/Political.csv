1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,1,"As you can guess from the places we're talking to people from, this is a podcast about voting rights measures and the boycotts and counterboycotts and broader cultural argument that they have kicked off. We talked last week about new restrictive voting measures that passed in Georgia that are under consideration as well in Texas."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,1,"This storyline has now ballooned into something else. It's a story about corporations weighing in on politics and a lot of Republicans getting very angry that they are doing so. Domenico, I'm really dwelling on the fact that you have a situation where Republicans are blasting Coca-Cola and baseball, which is, like, a real cultural plot twist. But we will talk about that in a moment."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,1,"Yeah. And, Ashley, no new law has been signed yet in Texas, but similar changes are being debated by lawmakers. What are the broad characteristics of the bill at question in Texas?"
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,3,"Well, similar in that these bills are aimed at addressing voter fraud, which there's no evidence that there's any widespread problem with, you know, voter fraud in Texas. And the bills that are being considered do things like not allow local election officials to just send people applications without them asking for them first, which, you know, only a couple of major counties did - have ever done that. So in terms of effect, this isn't very sweeping. But the bills do do things like expand what poll watchers can observe."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,3,"And then they also create, like, new rules for people who assist voters with disabilities. And more importantly, they create a slew of new criminal penalties for - related to voting, so that's something that voting rights advocates are watching closely. But, you know, it is a little different in that Texas is starting from a place of just having way stricter voting laws already."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,1,"Right. And one point that Georgia Republicans have made is even though these changes were put in place, Georgia still has a lot more early voting than a lot of states. But, Domenico, this really got charged up to the next level when Major League Baseball decided to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, which was shocking in a few reasons to me, mostly because Major League Baseball is a sport that tries very hard to not step in the middle of political controversies."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,2,"Yeah, it tries to be America's pastime - right? - and tries not to do a lot of that. But, you know, Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game as a political statement to Colorado. And Colorado is a place with much more flexible voting laws in place. It has one of the highest participation rates in the country because of an - almost all vote by mail, lots of drop-off locations, you know, and just far more accessible, even though Republicans have tried to muddy the water and say that it's very similar to Georgia's laws, which is not exactly true."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,1,"Emil, how has this been playing out in Georgia? - because you've got baseball. You've got, you know, companies like Delta and Coke weighing in and on one hand, being criticized for waiting until after the bill was signed into law and on the other hand, being criticized for saying something at all. Like, how is this affecting the actual politics in the state?"
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,2,"Well, you know, this is an interesting moment, especially for the Republican Party, because there's been such an emphasis in the Trump era, which I think we're still in because so many Trump supporters are really the base of the Republican Party now - that we're seeing this tension between cultural conservatism and the more traditional, you know, pro-business, pro-corporation conservatism. And, you know, there used to be a time when big corporations and the Republican Party were sort of synonymous."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,2,"And, Ashley, you mentioned Black Voters Matter expanding into Texas, and that's kind of the model that Stacey Abrams used with her group Fair Fight. She has expanded and - from the 2020 election expanded her group outreach into several different states. And we can kind of see that - that going from Georgia to these other states where voting rights are at stake."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,3,"Yeah, I got to say I'm not surprised to see groups looking at regions like the Sunbelt, where there's a large, you know, racial minority population and, you know, slightly changing politics or in Georgia's case, like, rapidly changing politics and seeing that as a space to do work like this because, you know, you get your bang for your buck here because there's just so many restrictive voting laws but also just so many potential voters and potential, you know, political change."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,2,"I think that's a great point because the growth - the demographic growth in the Sunbelt has been a real threat to Republican politics. And they've said so and made that case, in fact, even in court."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,1,"Yeah. And I mean, that's - we saw that affect the presidential map this year. And if these trends continue, it will definitely rewrite the presidential map in the next few cycles. Domenico, you have spent some time looking at the history of corporate boycotts. Broadly speaking, do they work? Do they get laws revoked? Do they change the politics of states?"
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,3,"Well, there have been many that have actually worked through the years. You know, you don't have to look too far back for some of the most recent ones, you know, really, a lot of this during the Trump era. But in 2016, 2017, we saw three of these against the NFL, the professional football league, the NRA, the National Rifle Association, and most importantly, in North Carolina when they passed limitations on LGBTQ rights that included restrictions on what bathrooms people could use. And that really backfired on the state of North Carolina because you had the NCAA, multiple states that didn't allow their employees and officials to travel to those states to do business."
1,Activists Stoke Corporate Backlash To Voting Restrictions,3,"The NCAA withheld - the National Collegiate Athletic Association withheld playing games in their state, where you have - obviously, basketball's pretty big with some pretty powerful schools there. And that did shift and change the conversation, not only the conversation but the law. The bill was repealed in 2017 after having been passed. So using that model and, frankly, some other models through history, this is what a lot of people who look at these boycotts and realize that money talks - that they're looking at."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"So Janelle Jones is the top economist at the Labor Department. She is the first Black woman to ever hold this role. I was interested in her because I was already following her on Twitter. I try to follow economists and people who have interesting things to say about the economy because, you know, I cover that sort of thing. And she..."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"..When she got the position, I wanted to know more about her, you know, especially since she's the first Black woman in this role. And I found out that, you know, she has this - you know, this framework for looking at the economy that I found really fascinating."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,5,"And, Ayesha, you talked to Janelle Jones just after we got this really fantastic jobs report, sort of blowing the past jobs reports out of the water, at least for the - in the recent past. And that seems like something that might be really good news for a post-pandemic recovery. But I'm curious - what did she have to say about this?"
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"Well, it was a jobs numbers that anyone - it was over 900,000 jobs added. So that was - that's a number that any administration is going to brag about. So they were certainly happy about it. But Jones had an interesting take on how to dig into the details of those numbers."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,6,"Yeah, it's a big day. We saw, you know, almost a million jobs added last month. We haven't seen numbers like that since August. We saw the unemployment rate going down. Just really good, strong job growth. Most of that came from the leisure and hospitality sector, where we know low-income workers are disproportionately represented, where Black and Brown women are overrepresented. So you know, we love to see it. So it was, overall, a really, really strong report."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"Do you - and I know you mentioned Black and Brown workers in the leisure, you know, sectors and things like that. We know that the Black community in particular was hit pretty hard by the coronavirus and the economic fallout from that. Right now, where do things stand for Black workers first and then, also, obviously, where do things stand for other marginalized communities?"
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,5,"What she cited there about the Black unemployment rate being so high, something that is sort of stunningly constant in economics in the American economy is that the Black unemployment rate tends to be roughly twice the white unemployment rate. But that's in good times and bad. It is an upsettingly constant thing. And so that points to broader structural issues that clearly, when, like, cyclical issues when the economy improves, that doesn't improve that. So this is something that is always around - good times and bad. And of course, now is not the greatest time."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,7,"Democrats say they learned a lot of lessons from the last time they had to do stimulus and government intervention during the financial crisis back, you know, more than a decade ago. She references it there about the recovery that - how long it took for Black women. In this recovery plan, are they mindful of that? Is it designed to be more targeted to the people that are most often left behind?"
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"It does seem like they tried, especially with, like, the child tax credit, which in particular will cut down on child poverty, especially for Black and Brown children. Like, that's going to have - it's only for a year, but it will have a very big impact - like, the child tax credit, the direct payments targeted to people that don't make as much and that making sure they all get these checks. So in that way, there were these things that did seem very focused on helping people who otherwise have not always benefited from, say, grants or government loans or things of that nature. So it does seem like they tried to target it. The - but the problem with all of this is dealing with those structural issues that Danielle was talking about and whether you can actually make a long-term difference."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,7,"And we're back. And we were just talking about who the recovery efforts are reaching and whether it's reaching everyone it needs to. And Ayesha, that is something that Jones had a very specific way of thinking about?"
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"Yes. One of the main reasons why I wanted to talk to her is that she has coined this phrase, Black women best, as a way of looking at the economy. And I was fascinated with this framework that she talks about because, you know, as I said earlier, a lot of times you think of economists, you think of, you know, older white men. And this is her way of kind of flipping the usual narrative."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,6,"So Black woman best is really a framework in an ideology that I try to center when I think about how the economy is working. I think it's a good way to measure how the economy is working, who it's working for. It's a good way to think about, you know, will this reach marginalized populations? Will this policy, will this targeted program, will these checks in the bank, will these shots and arms? Because I think, you know, if you send your workers who are usually left behind - and it's not, you know, Black women are often left behind in these types of measures. But if you send those workers, then we can make sure that everyone else is doing well. You know, the way the economy is set up, the way our institutions and systems are set up, if Black women are doing well, if Black women have, you know, economic security and stability, it really does ensure that all other types of demographics and groups are also doing well."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,6,"Yeah, I think - you know? I think it's definitely possible. And also, we've seen it before. There was a time in our economy where we saw workers moving together, where we saw, you know, as the economy was growing, workers were also reaping the benefits. The problem is for the past 30 or 40 years, we have not done that. Like we have seen worker power and worker benefits and worker wages really shrink over the past generation. And so I think, you know, folks think maybe that's what's possible, but it's not. And I think President Biden is rolling out a plan to make us - I mean, I hate to say it because it does feel like a commercial. But President Biden is rolling out a plan to truly build back better, not to where we were pre pandemic, not to where we were four years ago, but where we were a generation ago when we were a country that really centered and invested in public institutions and the middle class."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"And I want to get into what that looks like as a policy. Obviously, the American Rescue Plan, you know, just, you know, passed. Now there's this, you know, the president rolled out this infrastructure plan, which will also invest in human infrastructure. But I guess, can you talk about from your position, from your perch, what how do you translate centering marginalized groups into policy? Like, what does that actually look like?"
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,6,"Yeah, you know, something I'm really excited about in the infrastructure plan is this idea of targeting communities who have been kind of dissected by, you know, highways, just, like, being put right through their neighborhoods. Like, that is a restorative policy that is, that will bring, you know, all sorts of benefits to those communities. You know, we talk about, you know, replacing all of the lead pipes, we know that lead pipes are found disproportionately in Black and brown neighborhoods. That is helping Black and brown children. And so I think it's - you know, I think it's all of the things that the jobs package is doing is really centering and thinking about workers of color, low income workers, you know, really trying to do things that will help the protections and benefits of the middle class and kind of rebuild it since it has been, you know, hollowed out over the past generation or so."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,7,"It's almost like we need to rework our vocabulary when we're talking about this infrastructure bill, because it's definitely not in the traditional mode of an infrastructure bill."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,5,"Yeah. I mean, there's so much in this infrastructure bill. And also the language around it is very much clearly about, yes, we are fixing roads and bridges and also increasing broadband access, for example, and, you know, replacing lead pipes and things that are our real problems in our existing infrastructure. But the language around it is also very much about and we are doing this not just to improve the economy, but to make sure we are boosting marginalized communities. And, Ayesha, tell me if I'm right on this, actually. Every time I think about this infrastructure bill, I think, you know, there's clearly stuff in this. And I suppose I just said it myself, infrastructure bill. Every time we talk about this economic stimulus bill, I think, you know, yes, there is stuff in here to help recover from the pandemic. But this seems like they're taking the opportunity of there's an economic crisis, we are going to change very basic things about the economy or at least try to bolster basic things about the economy."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,4,"Well, and that's sort of what she seemed to be touching on and what they want to do. They don't want to go back to the status quo. And she said outright, I will not be satisfied if the economy returns back to where it was in February 2020 before the pandemic hit. They want something more dramatic and more fundamental. Now, that is a very tall order. And we should be clear this is what they are saying, this is what they are pushing. That's a tall order."
1,Top Biden Labor Economist: Boosting Black Women Benefits Everyone,5,"Yeah, and that's putting it mildly when you say hurdles (laughter). Yes, this is a $2 trillion plan at least. And there is a second part that the Biden administration has promised is coming as well. And it's not just Republicans who are saying they will balk at not just the stuff in it, but the price tag itself. But there have been some more moderate Democrats who have said that they're a little bit hesitant also about spending yet more money. And by the way, since we have an economy that was able to add 900,000 jobs last month, that might signal that the economy is doing well. And that might be an argument if you're a Republican or if you're opposed to this plan, that maybe we don't need this plan."
1,A Full Court Press: The Supreme Court Considers Expanded Benefits For Student Athletes,9,"There's another way to think about what's going on here, and that's that schools that are naturally competitors as to athletes have all gotten together in an organization, an organization that has undisputed market power, and they use that power to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels, far lower than what the market would set if it were allowed to operate."
1,A Full Court Press: The Supreme Court Considers Expanded Benefits For Student Athletes,8,"They certainly did. I'm interpreting here, but, you know, they were very hostile to the NCAA's position on the one hand, and on the other, I'm not quite sure that they're quite sure about how to fix it. They're worried about, whatever they do, will it change this, the whole idea of amateur sports. And here, for example, is Justice Sonia Sotomayor."
1,A Full Court Press: The Supreme Court Considers Expanded Benefits For Student Athletes,8,"A lot of these kids, if they're really fabulous and heading to the pros ultimately, they play for a year until they've reached an age when the - when they can qualify in the pros, and they go to the pros."
1,A Full Court Press: The Supreme Court Considers Expanded Benefits For Student Athletes,8,"And, you know, when I was prepping for this story, I was really interested that most of the folks that I called said that these schools that participate, for example, in March Madness and benefit from it use some of that money to subsidize other sports. And they call them the country club sports..."
1,Gov. Kristi Noem Hopes To Court Conservatives By Banning Trans Girls From Sports,10,"Yeah. So the executive orders essentially state that in South Dakota, only females based on their biological sex as reflected in their birth certificate or an affidavit can participate in girls or women's athletics events that are sanctioned by, you know, public schools, any kind of state school. It also directs the colleges in the state to do essentially the same thing. I think it's kind of important to note that Noem has never really said that these executive orders - or in the past when she's voiced support for bills that kind of failed in the state legislature, that she said that these only, you know, protect opportunities for women and girls sports and that they're not particularly targeted towards transgender people."
1,Gov. Kristi Noem Hopes To Court Conservatives By Banning Trans Girls From Sports,10,"Yeah, it's very deliberate. I mean, you know, when you talk with supporters of the bills and folks who've brought the bills, you know, they really just focus on women's athletics and Title IX and sort of, like I said, what they call the physical differences between the two biological sexes. There's a lot of focus on biological sex as well."
1,Gov. Kristi Noem Hopes To Court Conservatives By Banning Trans Girls From Sports,6,"The language here is very interesting because you say that they focus this about women and seemingly pro-women. But in her tweet announcing the orders, she said, quote, ""only girls should play girls' sports,"" which is very political language. That is language that has been embraced by the social conservative movement, but language that LGBT rights advocates would consider transphobic language. And it seems like they're being very targeted in how they speak about this issue. It's a little bit of a dog whistle, I would say."
1,Gov. Kristi Noem Hopes To Court Conservatives By Banning Trans Girls From Sports,6,"So the Statehouse had essentially passed a bill and sent it to her to sign that would have codified some of these transgender restrictions. But she chose not to sign it, and yet she's signing these executive orders. So what's her strategy here? What is she trying to do?"
1,Gov. Kristi Noem Hopes To Court Conservatives By Banning Trans Girls From Sports,11,"..Like some sci-fi disaster movies about to hit. And, you know, the reason for that was the president was talking about what could happen if all the trends keep going in the right direction. And it was based on some big assumptions. And the big one was that people would continue to be careful to give the country enough time to get lots of people vaccinated. But what's happened in the interim is what everyone was kind of worried about. The pandemic fatigue would win out, and people would start letting down their guard too soon."
1,Gov. Kristi Noem Hopes To Court Conservatives By Banning Trans Girls From Sports,11,"So, you know, I've been in touch with a lots of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts. And unfortunately, I have to say they're all pretty much saying the same sort of thing, that unfortunately, it looks pretty inevitable that we probably will see some sort of another surge. Hopefully it won't be anything like the horrific winter surge that we just went through. A matter of fact, very few people think it could get that bad. And the reason for that is that too many people already have some immunity at this point because they've been exposed to the virus. Millions of people have now been vaccinated. And millions more are getting vaccinated every day. But how bad it gets really depends on how people behave."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"Yeah, you're right. It's a lot. So this is a law that's nearly a hundred pages long, and it really touches the election code top to bottom. And so that's why it's really confusing when it's being painted, you know, by Republicans as great and by Democrats as terrible because there's a lot of nuance, so I'll try to take us through it. So, you know, one headline that Republicans have touted is that unlike previous versions of the bill, this expands early voting weekend requirements, so it expands early voting access in some counties."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,6,"Well, last week in Georgia, Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed a new Republican-sponsored law that will affect virtually every aspect of your state's elections. Republicans say these are needed reforms, but Democrats and voting rights groups say it will disproportionately affect voters of color, making it harder for them to cast their ballots. In one really dramatic clash over the law, Democratic state Representative Park Cannon, who's a Black woman, was arrested by Capitol Police after knocking on the governor's office door as he was making remarks after signing the law."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"It shortens the window for absentee ballot applications. On the flip side, they are shortening the window on the other end, so you could request an absentee ballot from 180 days before an election. Now it's 78 days. That's something that people take issue with. There's absentee ballot drop boxes. So those don't exist in Georgia code. They were created in emergency."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"Because of the pandemic, exactly. And so this new law puts them into code, but it adds new restrictions as to where they can be. So now they have to be inside an early voting location and only accessible during early voting hours. So that's some of the headlines, tons of stuff, but it really does focus on early voting and absentee voting."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"Right. And that's really - kind of gets at the heart of this difference between the two parties on this. So Republicans, you know, they have argued that this law is because of the need to shore up voter confidence after the 2020 election, particularly their Republican voters who are - were questioning the system after false claims of voter fraud, like you said. But they're also saying, you know, remember back in 2018 when Stacey Abrams, you know, accused us of voter suppression, and she questioned the election integrity then. You know, we're trying to address those concerns as well. And then Republicans are also pointing to, you know, back in the June primary, when Georgia saw - some parts of Georgia saw really horrible lines because, you know, the system really wasn't ready for a pandemic primary with all the absentee ballots. And so it's all of that the Republicans are pulling in to their argument about it."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"But Democrats are saying this is sour grapes. You lost, and you are playing into false claims of voter fraud, and you're trying to change the system and shave off points going forward."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,13,One of the things that we're hearing from voting rights advocates is that this is a major attack on specifically the rights of voters of color. Can you talk a little bit about that?
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"Yeah, so I mean, anything that's adding a restriction to voting, a barrier of any sort, advocates are saying, will disproportionately affect voters of color, voters who are poor, new Georgians, immigrants, and, you know, people who are disabled, combined with Georgia and the South's terrible history with voting access and actual voter suppression of the civil rights era. So Democrats argue it's a terrible look. They argue that it will have real consequences. But Republicans, for their part, really rankle at this characterization. They point to expanding weekend early voting access, like I said. They point to a new rule in the law that says if a precinct has voting lines of up to an hour, the next election they have to do something about it. They have to split up the precinct, so they're arguing that is a complete mischaracterization."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,13,"And that's becoming part of the conversation around the voting rights law that was named for former Congressman John Lewis that has passed the House and that is just waiting in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate say that they are going to block this bill written by Democrats over concerns that it goes too far, that it overreaches, that it could actually cause huge problems in the voting systems by forcing people to make changes too quickly. And that tension that is being sparked in Georgia is also creating a greater push from activists and from Democrats to get rid of the filibuster so that the voting rights protections can be passed in the Senate and become law. So these things are all kind of molding together. What is, to some degree, a state-level fight about voting access in Georgia is becoming an argument about the filibuster and the future of progressive policies in Congress."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"And, Kelsey, I mean, I asked Senator Jon Ossoff this question earlier today. Does Georgia's new law add more pressure at the federal level for this kind of legislation? And, you know, sort of also the question is about the filibuster, right? And he said he thinks it definitely boosts that. I wonder whether you think it'll really translate into meaningful umph in Washington."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,13,"You know, this is something that I've been talking to people about a lot. And one of the ways that I had it explained to me by one activist was that they said that it has more connectivity. It moves the filibuster from being, like, this squishy thing about institutions and protecting a gauzy idea of bipartisanship and makes it visceral and personal and makes it an issue that people are really animated by. But there's a difference between animating people who were already animated and animating, you know, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who wants to defend the filibuster."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"Yeah, we've already got two major lawsuits, one from the NAACP, one from a coalition of groups, including the local Georgia voting rights group. And then also for 2022, I'm thinking a lot about the political implications here because those are very real. And the truth about this law is that it gives both Republicans and Democrats something they can really use on the campaign trail. For Republicans, it's something that they're going to try to use to shore up confidence of their voters in the system. And then for Democrats, this is a huge - this is something they can really use against Republicans."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,12,"They can continue to make their argument that Republicans are, quote, ""vote suppressors."" And they are already fundraising on this. Republicans are also fundraising on it, I might add. And so it's really going to be front and center in Georgia for a while."
1,Will A New Georgia Law Restrict Voter Access Or Restore Faith In Elections?,13,"Well, that kind of speaks to national pressure - right? - on Republicans. With former President Trump still in the background, a lot of Republicans are still attempting to kind of reconcile the misinformation that he spread during the 2020 election about, you know, local officials being at the center of, what he said, was widespread fraud, of misinformation about widespread fraud and that this is not - this is happening in Texas, but this is not a unique concern to Texas Republicans."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",14,"And you are here because we are talking about the mass shooting in Boulder, Colo., earlier this week, in particular the legislative efforts around it. But first, some new information about how the perpetrator obtained his gun - he got it legally after passing a background check, a state background check. That is according to reporting from the AP, Carrie."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",15,"That's right. And, you know, many or maybe even most firearms used in some of these big mass shootings that have really attracted national attention over many years turned out to have been legally purchased, which makes this problem a really, really hard one. You know, we have this big problem with gun violence. A big chunk of the gun deaths annually around the country are a result of suicide. And it's just really a hard, hard situation."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",14,"Yeah. And certainly, background checks have over time prevented millions of weapons from being sold to people who shouldn't have them. But quite frequently - and this becomes part of the politics. Quite frequently in the case of these high-profile mass shootings, those guns were obtained legally, as in this case."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",14,"Indeed. It's very hard to track that. So, Bente, I feel like Colorado has taken more than its fair share of this problem of mass shootings. There have been these cases that are seared in our collective conscience - Columbine, Aurora - these names - and now Boulder."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",16,"I would just quickly note that after Sandy Hook, even if nothing happened federally, Colorado did pass some significant gun measures after Sandy Hook. That was the same year that we had the Aurora theater shooting - so both of those incidents. And then lawmakers passed universal background checks and a high-capacity magazine ban."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",14,"So, Bente, we're talking about state legislation. We're not talking about federal legislation, in part because it doesn't seem like anything is going to happen. As we say, it didn't happen after Sandy Hook. I mean, it seems like there really is, in the absence of federal action - and there has not been any substantial federal action on this issue since the 1990s, the early 1990s. It does seem like a sort of a patchwork of state law changes have been happening, like after Parkland in Florida, for instance, or now. Certainly, Colorado has been doing some things."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",16,"That's absolutely right. And the lawmakers I've talked to here say that that's why they feel like Colorado has to do something. They say it's not an ideal approach to have a patchwork of laws. Preliminary discussions are already underway for a ban on assault-style weapons across Colorado. And there's been a lot of talk about this, but the city of Boulder had actually passed its own assault weapons ban back in 2018. And that was a response to the Parkland shooting in Florida. And earlier this month, a state judge struck that down because in Colorado, like some states, cities can't pass stricter gun laws than the state has."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",16,"So that's why some lawmakers from Boulder are saying, look; we need a statewide ban. There's going to be a lot of opposition to that, though, as well. And even some Democrats - it's going to be a tough vote in a state where gun ownership is - a lot of proud gun owners, a lot of people who feel like this violates the Second Amendment. And so I think the political debate is going to be very, very tough if we see a bill."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",14,"And, Carrie, inevitably, when there are Second Amendment questions, this could end up headed to the Supreme Court, you know, to settle differences between states, for instance."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",15,"I think we're going to see a lot of this, Tam. Clarence Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas, has been calling on the court to take up some Second Amendment cases. The court has been really reluctant ever since that Heller case some years ago. And now we have a new member of the court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Amy Coney Barrett is a strong proponent of Second Amendment rights. And, in fact, one of her most important opinions at the lower court level was on Second Amendment rights. And she was arguing that some people convicted of crimes should regain their right to own firearms."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",15,"And the court is considering whether to hear a bunch of gun-related arguments and cases. The most pressing might be whether there is a right to carry outside your home. And the court has not opined on that yet, but we may be getting some more arguments and some decisions out of a new Supreme Court."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",16,"I think the biggest thing I'll be looking at is this statewide assault weapons ban. I'm fairly confident we're going to see a bill, and it could very likely, you know, move through the legislative process. Democrats do hold the majority in both chambers of the legislature. Our governor is a Democrat. So I think, you know, this is such a sweeping policy that was never discussed publicly until the Boulder shooting happened. And so it will be unprecedented if that moves through the Colorado legislature this session."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",18,"Yeah. I mean, I think it's important to note that it was really clear yesterday that these lawmakers are closer than we've ever seen them before to regulating these companies. And to be able to justify that regulation, you know, lawmakers need to establish a problem. So they kept going back to this over and over again. You know, do you accept responsibility for what happened, for the violence that a lot of experts pin on misinformation over the last couple months about election results, for instance? Mark Zuckerberg was asked that specifically by Mike Doyle, who's a Democrat from Pennsylvania. Here's what he said."
1,"As Biden And Congress Delay Action On Guns, Colorado Mulls Restrictions",18,"That change might also be driven a little bit by politics, too, because right when they start talking about moderation, Mark Zuckerberg was really clear that he wanted to pin some of the blame for January 6 specifically on former President Trump. And so, you know, I think some of the Republican lawmakers were probably seeing this as a slippery road to go down, where they don't want to be talking about former President Trump's Twitter account and, you know, whether - the question of whether, you know, his account should have been locked earlier, potentially. And so kind of avoiding the entire concept of moderation seemed to be a strategy yesterday."
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",19,"Yeah, so it's been kind of a roller coaster. So yesterday, AstraZeneca said, look, we've got some trial results from the trials that we've been having in the U.S. and a couple other countries. It looks good. Well, you know, our vaccine appears to be 79% effective at keeping people from getting sick from COVID. But then overnight, we got, you know, some news from the data safety monitoring board - this is a group of experts that advises the U.S. National Institutes of Health. And they basically accused AstraZeneca of using outdated data to make their vaccine look more effective. And they basically said that they were kind of misleading the public, you know?"
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",14,"Yeah. So the Biden administration has been reluctant thus far, even though we know in the future that the U.S. is going to have way more, like, hundreds of millions more vaccine doses than there are actually Americans. The Biden administration has been reluctant to respond to requests for vaccine sharing, but they announced that they are planning to share about a total of 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Canada and Mexico, our continental neighbor. This is sort of a first foray into what is called vaccine diplomacy."
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",19,"And that's really unfortunate. I mean, you know, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease doc, was on ""Good Morning America"" this morning calling it an unforced error. He said that the AstraZeneca vaccine is very likely still a good vaccine. But, you know, this kind of miscommunication is what's sowing distrust in the public. So, you know, there's a lot more to come on this. You know, it's still a couple weeks away."
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",19,AstraZeneca is still a few weeks away from applying for emergency use authorization here in the U.S. And I guess the message that U.S. regulators are currently sending is that they're going to be reviewing that data independently and they're going to really not let that product through if it doesn't pass their standards.
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",14,"Yeah, absolutely. And the thing is, this AstraZeneca vaccine, while it isn't authorized for use in the U.S., it is authorized for use all over the world. It is one of the main vaccines being used in Europe. And there were some questions about safety that have mostly been resolved there. And in Canada and Mexico, it's authorized for use there. And yet the U.S. has this stockpile of preordered vaccines that can't be used for Americans. And so, you know, what good does that do? A lot of countries, including Canada and Mexico, but apparently many others have been eyeing this stash of about 7 million vaccines that could be sent out or are available for distribution and saying, hey, could we get some of that."
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",19,"Sweetening the deal, yeah (laughter). So Krispy Kreme is offering a free doughnut a day to anyone who comes in with a card that shows that they're vaccinated. And as a health reporter, I might not be able to actually endorse a doughnut a day. But as a person, I will say that doughnuts as a sometimes food are totally delicious."
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",20,"Listen. If you're interested in politics in the U.S., you should be interested in the census because these are population numbers from a national headcount required by the Constitution once every 10 years, used to determine how many Electoral College votes your state gets in determining who is the next president of the United States, how many members in the House of Representatives represent your state in Congress for the next decade. These are also numbers that determine the areas other elected officials represent all the way down to your local city council and school board members."
1,"US Loans Vaccines To Mexico, Canada",20,"Well, the head of the Census Bureau, the acting director, Ron Jarmin, is expected to testify. And I'm watching to see how he responds to presumably a lot of questions from lawmakers about the timing, this timeline, this schedule, and see if there are any new signals that the Census Bureau may be shifting its schedule given maybe have made some progress in some aspect. I'm also to see just the line of questioning from different lawmakers and depending on their political affiliations, their party, because the fact is the bureau has missed a legal reporting deadline for the first set of results and is expected to miss that second reporting deadline. And so Congress presumably needs to pass a new law that extends those deadlines formally."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,22,"would you have then backed into the second place further behind you? In other words, did your property right in here to the front space or to any space that you could back in to? And while I’m here, I have a second question. Let’s say you were on the phone for a second and paused to answer a text before you backed into that space. Did your right to that parking space disappear during the time it took to answer that text? What if you had made a five minute phone call then or ten minute phone call then would you write to that space ever be lost? And at this point, the guy in the Tesla just threw up his hands and said, I don’t have time for this. He got in his car and drove off and the old man turned to the handful of us who had been watching this. And he said the case is moot. And he turned to the woman he was with and he said, God, I miss it so much already. And he walked away and this woman from the white SUV called after him. Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,21,"the fantasy story ends with Justice Breyer missing it so much already, I feel like you haven’t given him the proper incentive for the outcome you’re searching for here."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,23,"But I feel like we just had to endure David’s vocal exercises and I’d like to stage an intervention. Sorry. David is feeling very spacious in his Justice Breyer narratives. At current rates, the entire show is going to be the Justice Breyer narrative is"
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,22,"Yeah, they shouldn’t. They should decrease it by then. They can increase it back to the number. Oh, that said. All right, fine. I’ll keep it shorter next week if I hadn’t resigned. But it’s just a threat to him. We have talked about the wave of voter suppression legislation that’s racing through state legislatures controlled by Republicans. Georgia has passed the first major constricting law, SB 202, SB 202, which did a whole bunch of things that tightened absentee voting, that limited drop boxes, and particularly in areas where there are a lot of Democratic voters and to me, most alarmingly changed the composition of the state election board in a way that makes it very much easier for it to be tinkered with for four, the election board to end up overriding certain results if they want to certain results."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,23,"And the lieutenant governor of Georgia on CNN basically said, you know, I went back and and looked at where all of this energy for voting reform came from. And it really was when Rudy Giuliani came down after the election and met with a bunch of committees and talked for two hours spreading lies about the election. This is the Republican lieutenant governor, Jeff Duncan of of Georgia. So, yeah, affirming your point, Emily."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,22,"Well, so we I think they have the two issues here. We have the issue of the law and then we have the issue of a corporate and other responsive law, Coke and Delta. Both big Georgia companies have very belatedly ex post facto condemned to this new law. Major League Baseball, in the highest profile action, moved its all star game from Georgia to Colorado in response to public pressure from a group led by, I think, led by former American Express CEO Ken Chennault. So. Do you guys think I mean, let’s let’s let’s start with the law and move to the corporate response, which is, you know, this law is just going to be the first of many, right, Emily? And what’s and what is most alarming about is it that is that the voter restrictions or is it the change in the composition of the board?"
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,21,"Well, the change in the composition of the board and the sort of politicization of handling the results in Georgia alarms me because we it it creates a scenario in which the answer to the questions of let’s throw the November twenty twenty election into disarray and uncertainty, the answer could be different. I think it’s important to remember here the work that the office of Secretary of State did in Georgia and other states to kind of neutralize that threat. That’s an elected office, but it is tend to be held by someone who is in a more kind of civil servant position. And that really mattered in Georgia. And Brad Raffensperger, like, took a lot of hits for it from the Republican Party. And now we’ve seen him and his office stripped of power. So I think that is really worth worrying about, even though it’s the more it’s the after the election problem, the the election voting problem is also, I think, of concern. And, you know, there was a lot of debate in the last week about how much access and making voting easier matters in terms of turnout and partisan makeup. It is true that, you know, universal vote by mail in the states to have it like Colorado and Washington."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,21,"And Utah hasn’t created this surge in voting. It’s associated more with like a two percent increase. And it’s not clear necessarily what the partisan implications are. But if you care about democratic participation and you also have your eye on the long, the long game here, and you’re just trying to create an America in which people find voting convenient and easy, and maybe that helps on the margin attract more of them. That seems like those are good things. We don’t really know how it plays out yet in states that haven’t had universal vote by mail. And so that in particular bothered me. And then there are other things like not giving food and water to people on long lines, which just seem like, you know, mean spirited and kind of Dickensian"
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,23,"The change in what the legislature can do after the results come in is the most dangerous because the other changes, let’s say they go through, you can mobilize voters to deal with the new laws. You can. And as you said, it’s unclear what impact this really has on turnout. There’s some scholarship which we’ve talked about before, which suggests that that the group being denied its rights or having them constrained actually turns out more because they feel threatened. But that’s something that’s a problem you can see coming the dark of night changes in the I mean, look at what happened in Georgia after this election, which was all out in the open. There were recordings. You had Republicans standing up and it still was a lot of people were watching and thinking that that something might happen and the vote might flip somehow because of Republican pressure. And this creates a permission structure and a pathway to have that happen. And it would happen in a less transparent way. That seems to and now I’m not saying this is what’s led to the public debate, I think, and the public pressure. I think the other stuff about access to voting and absentee ballots and all of that is probably what’s more fuel the public backlash."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,22,"Are there good examples, Emily, of subversion by state legislatures or by state election boards where in this country where elections have been overturned because of of interventions that were really out of bounds?"
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,21,"It’s a good question. I can’t think of one off the top of my head. I mean, I’m sure they exist. Right? But this usually I’m trying to think of there any statewide examples of that. I can’t."
2,The “Midnight Train From Georgia” Edition,23,"ell, the election of eighteen twenty four. Oh. Which you thrown into the House of Representatives and Jackson supporters thought that there was basically a side deal between Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams, and that was a backroom deal where the legislature essentially stole the election from the winner."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,24,"Listeners, buckle up. Well, shall we go on today’s gabfests? We’ll talk about the immigration crisis. Is there an immigration crisis at the southern border and elsewhere in the United States? Then we’re going to talk about violence and harassment of Asian-Americans in the wake of the murders in Atlanta and data suggesting incidents against Asian-Americans have risen dramatically in the last year. We’re going to talk to Professor Claire Jeanne Kim of the University of California, Irvine, about that. Then we’re going to be joined by Alec McGillis to talk about his book Fullfillment, which is about Amazon and Amazon’s effect on the United States and the Amazon Union fight and what that tells us about the state of America. Plus, what a gaffe on Fox News this week. Did you guys catch this? Fox News mocked former Justice Stephen Breyer for writing the majority opinion in last week’s landmark death penalty case, even though Breyer resigned from the court a month ago. And is it even city 08? That didn’t happen because Breyer is still there in his black robe. Plus, of course, we have cocktail chatter. Emily, I appreciate your smile or your benevolent, indulgent smile."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"Well, they have to because David has to keep it real. Also, David discovered that I years ago wrote a piece called Stop Telling Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Retire, which is like my most what’s that word, ignominious moment on the Internet? Because I was trying to make the point that, like a bunch of white men, like bullying her, sort of berating her into retiring was not going to be effective. But it just says stop telling her to shore. And so it lives on forever. And my children particularly find it just so wrenching and awful that I wrote this piece. There should be."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,26,"Understand that. But willfully misunderstood, willfully misinterpreting a headline after you’ve read the piece is not grounds for blaming her. It’s just your choice to make the piece about something other than what the piece is about."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,24,"Right. But it was the 20 percent extra. Yeah. What I will say is I’m pretty sure on the show a number of times after that, I said that RBG absolutely should retire like it was never that I thought she shouldn’t retire. It was about the tactics that the right."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"So I’m not going to say that’s not even a segment. Look at this, listeners. It’s like your slate plus members who didn’t even have to join. You got a bonus. All right. Our first topic is there an immigration crisis in the United States? There’s been a rise in apprehensions on the southern border of the United States in the last few months. And there are now more than 15000 unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. custody. Republicans are railing against the administration for inviting migrants from Mexico and Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador to come to the U.S., even though the Biden administration has pretty clearly been saying don’t come now. Emily, is there a crisis or is this just a seasonal fluctuation combined with the Biden administration trying to kind of make up for years of rather draconian and chaotic Trump southern border policies?"
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,24,"I mean, I think it’s a crisis to have all these kids who, you know, are not with their parents who need to have a good place to live. It is a seasonal fluctuation. There’s also a good piece in Vox by Nicole Nuriya, my lovely former research assistant who is doing such a good job covering this beat, pointing out that their hurricanes happened recently in Nicaragua and I think Guatemala and Honduras that have had a, you know, really bad affect on local economies. And that’s also contributing probably to people coming. It makes sense that at the end of the Trump administration, even if it wasn’t true, that, you know, Biden was going to throw open the doors that a lot of people who’d waited to come would start coming. It’s also in line with the usual uptick in early spring. And also the pandemic is ebbing. So for a variety of reasons, we have thousands of kids to figure out what to do with. And this is a really hard problem. It’s really hard."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"So as I understand it, maybe I’m wrong about this. The the reason the there’s this huge surge in unaccompanied children is that both the Trump administration and and now the administration very, very clear, like families, you’re not getting in. But the Bush administration has now said that children unaccompanied will be not immediately like thrown back from whence they came or some not even from whence they came, but will be taken care of. And therefore, there is a small incentive. And I think I think it’s really gross for people to say, oh, this you know, this means all these Central American parents, like, you know, they don’t care. They’re just going to send their kids. They don’t even think about the well-being of the children. They just think America is going to take care of them. I mean, that’s nonsense. But there is a small sense like, well, if your child is traveling alone, they may they may be treated more kindly and more more welcomed into the United States than if we traveled as a family."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"Yeah, I mean, to me, there’s this as somebody who’s, like, really ambivalent about a lot of these issues. The thing that I find frustrating is the mal framing or the the failure to. Focus on immigration issues where the United States can do things that will be good and make obvious progress. I think the situation in the southern border and the migrant it’s driven by economics is by climate, by whether by violence, by drug trafficking, like this confluence of issues. And it’s really hard to imagine it being fixed by anyone. But there are issues around like H-1B visas around encouraging students to come to the U.S. around not persecuting green card holders, around, not trying to make life difficult for someone who has a green card and wants to become a citizen around making it easier to become citizens. Those are issues that I would really love to see as much focus on as these issues. Now, obviously, there you can look at a bunch of them and hopefully the Bush administration is looking at those as well. But just it’s those are issues where where it’s clear, like there’s you know, the U.S. needs more migrants, skilled migrants who want to come here and it needs to have families reunited and and not helping that out and not focusing on that is is going to be bad in the long term."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,24,"The confluence of factors you cited for the cause of the push, the push out of these countries is correct. But I disagree that there’s nothing we can do about that, like there was a real disinvestment in giving aid to this part of Latin America during the Trump administration, which I think is really bad. And when you sort of move out globally, I mean, migration is going to be like it already is a huge issue, but it’s only going to continue. I mean, the climate crisis, the changing weather patterns, there is going to be such such a push out of the southern hemisphere if, you know, current climate trends continue and we need some kind of global solution for asylum and we have never had it. It’s always been this total patchwork. Countries really don’t adhere to international law and allowing for asylum. And usually what happens in a crisis is you have tons of people go to like a neighboring country that is less wealthy and stable. So, you know, Syrians moving into Turkey or this remain in Mexico policy that the Trump administration put in place, put a lot of burden on Mexico to house all these people who are trying to get to the United States. And I you know, we were just talking at a granular level about the U.S. and that makes sense. That’s our focus. But it’s really this like global set of factors that that I think matters the most and figuring out how this how there could possibly be a better way."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"Yeah, know for sure. And I didn’t mean to imply there was nothing to do, nothing to do to stabilize. I just I guess what I was trying to suggest is like there are things you can do to stabilize. But actually the global trends, like the large scale trends, are very unfavorable and undesirable. If you think the climate situation is bad now, if you think a drought in Central America is bad now, wait ten years. Yeah, it is a situation where we certainly should be doing all that we can to help people stay in the countries, in the communities where they live. But it’s also naive to think that it’s not going to be terrible. And and there isn’t like I don’t think that the solution. To the problems of migration and in this hemisphere are everyone moves north to the United States and Canada, I just don’t think it can work. The United States is not like the politics of this country are not going to accept that that. But I just don’t. But yet there’s also the situation, which is that tens of millions of people are going to be at risk and commiserated. And so I don’t know how those two things meet."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,26,"Well, and also, when you talk about the politics, I think what one of the things that’s a part of this is that. We have to think through. The amount of effort it would take for an administration to manage these sets of issues when they show up at the border and to be more welcoming, it may an administration may be able to stake its capital on adjudicating these questions and making and aligning American policy with a more welcoming set of values. So and that may be what everybody wants. The thing is that has operate there are opportunity costs in time, attention and political capital that that affect an administration’s policies and abilities in other in all these other areas where an administration tries to get work done. So it’s not just yay or nay on specific policies. There’s also a way in which immigration has really affected other kinds of policies administrations have tried to put forward by changing the political climate domestically in the states."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,24,"I mean, I will just say that I disagree with what you said earlier, David. I think we could have tens of millions more people in this country in terms of the effect on the country. Like, I think I buy into the kind of crazy excuses I buy into the economic research that suggests that, like, yes, yes, there are costs sometimes locally and cost to particular people. And I see that. And I think we should address that. Like other low wage workers, often people who recently immigrated are the people who get pushed out of the labor force or lose some jobs to the people who got here last. I see that problem, but I also see the research that shows tremendous economic potential. I think you were making a different point, which is about the political viability"
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"I also think that we’re into in the world that we’re heading to in terms of the climate. I’m reading this really grim climate book, which is maybe making me more apocalyptic than I would, is just going to make a book ministry for the Future. Kim Stanley Robinson. It’s a novel. It’s actually not that it’s less grim, it’s more hopeful, but it’s still pretty grim. It makes me just think like the politics are going to get more exclusionary and more nationalistic and more more violent in opposition to those others who seek to to kind of take our space. Can I Emily, can I take us back to sort of a more tactical and quotidian question, which is that one of the reasons that President Trump was able to carry out such brutal and and in some ways extremely effective policies on immigration, restricting immigration, treating people at the border so brutally was that the courts gave him a huge latitude like the courts. Basically, there were, you know, moments of restraint by courts here and there. But there there just was no there was no massive legal crackdown. And because also Trump knew that Congress would not be able to act like the courts are always like, well, if Congress wants to do this, they can legislatively change this. But otherwise, we’re going to give we give the president a wide berth when it comes to matters of immigration and the border. Do you think that same thing will hold true for president? But will the is there a Biden equivalent where Biden can do extremely expansive things around immigration as an executive and the courts will give him latitude saying that, oh, if Congress wants to stop him, they can stop him?"
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,24,"Well, I mean, the courts already said no to his 100 day pause on deportations. You know, generally in immigration law, when you’re talking about like individual case adjudication, people just have almost no rights. Like immigration law is like a place in which like there’s almost no constitutional principle. Like so there is so little due process. It’s like really bleak for lawyers who are litigating this. And there is this important rule that the Trump administration put in place that the Biden people have not revoked or rescinded, that continues to just give enormous discretion to the president, the executive, in a way that allows people to be excluded. So I think there are some really interesting questions to watch about how much the administration is going to sort of self restrain. And I yeah, I don’t quite know what will happen, but the courts have been very willing to go along with immigration restrictive policies from the president."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"What I wonder is what the what is the ultimate value at the center of the Bush administration or politics or American politics in general. So everything now is happening in the wake of correcting the Trump administration’s policies, whether it’s. Sending all migrants into Mexico to live for two years in awful conditions, whether it’s dropping all the foreign policy that was in place to do the careful, slow spade work in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, or whether it’s changing the Central American minors program, like all of that is corrective and repairing it happens in the context of the Trump administration. But then what is the ultimate Biden? So do people think it’s part of an American value to have lots of inflows, either for economic reasons or moral reasons? And and who who who determines what that is? Reunifying families to fix the Trump administration is different than are we a country that welcomes families and. And how many and for what reason? And it feels like that doesn’t get figured out until I mean, that’s going to be very hard to figure out in and of itself. But also it’s it’s hard to figure out why you’re trying to do all of these, you know, repair efforts from the Trump years."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"Slate plus members super excited about our Slate plus topic this week. It’s going to be a really great discussion. I hope I’m anticipating a great discussion about it. A sports conundrum that Emily and her family faces regarding the rules of basketball and the rules of refereeing and how it impacted a school in New Haven, Connecticut. Two Democratic senators, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, told the White House on Tuesday that they would vote against all of President Biden’s non diversity appointees, that if those who aren’t racial minorities or LGBTQ until the White House appointed another Asian-American and Pacific Islander. Person to a prominent position or made some sort of commitment for doing that down the road, they threatened that, then they pulled that back. But that was in part a response to some of the real anger, fear and frustration in Asian-American communities following the Atlanta murder spree that killed six people of Asian descent among its eight victims. There are also reports that suggest a huge upsurge in harassment and attacks of Asian-Americans in the last year. We’re joined by Claire Jane Kim, who’s a professor of political science and Asian-American studies at UC Irvine. She’s working on a book, Asian-Americans in an Antiblack World, which is a great title. I love that title. Claire Jean Smith, welcome to The Gabfest. Can you start by talking about this idea of racial triangulation and how it is important to understand what’s happening with racial and class conflict in America?"
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,27,"Hi, David. Thanks for having me. So you’re asking me about the racial triangulation idea, and that’s a theory that I advanced in the nineteen ninety nine article by that name. And in that article I was really trying to say, when we look at how Asian-Americans are racialized and positioned in US society, it’s different than how black people are racialized in position. So how do we think through that difference? And I try to postulate that, you know, Asian-Americans are triangulated vis a vis blacks and whites seen as more foreign, but also superior to black people. So there are different axes for assessing these different groups. I’ve actually moved away from that theory. It seems to be taken up by some people right now, but I am moving away from that for my book, Asian-Americans in the Antiblack World, which I’m finishing up right now."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,27,"What I’m moving toward is I’m trying to theorize again, where are Asians positioned in U.S. society? And the theory is that most of Asian-American studies as a field has focused on white supremacy and how white people pushed down Asian-Americans or persecute them through various kinds of laws. And what I’m interested in is looking at how the racial order is structured, in addition by anti blackness. So how do what happens when we think about white supremacy is pushing all non-white groups down, but anti blackness as lifting up all not black groups? And that would mean Asian-Americans are sort of pushed down by white supremacy, but also elevated by anti blackness, elevated over black people. So that leads me to theorizing that Asian-Americans have something, a property called not blackness that advantages them. That is sort of like you could think of it as a structural advantage relative to black people, even as at the same time they have not whiteness, which is a structural disadvantage relative to whites,"
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,26,"which makes it, it would seem to me, a highly complex and moving picture to try to. Look at this, because you’re not you’re talking about two different groups as those two are changing in real time."
2,The “Unfulfilled” Edition,25,"Do you think, Claire, I remember one of them was a professor at my college who I think wrote a book called How the Irish Became White, which in a class I did not take. But this idea that there are certain groups and I seem to remember it being Italian and Irish immigrants who are allowed to become white after not being perceived as white and as a Jew, I feel like a lot of Jews have sort of made them like they strongly identify with their Americanness a generation ago in an effort to be seen as more white or do. Do Asian or Asian Americans, do you think, headed towards a path where Asian-Americans become white or no, you think they remain as a distinct group?"
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,28,"I think it’s always hard to tell what people actually do when they see other people doing it. And it is safe, right? I mean, the levels of vaccine hesitancy were much higher a couple of months ago before anybody had it. Right. And now we’re seeing our family and our friends go out and get it. They’re living a more normal life. So who actually knows if it will happen? But what I do find really fascinating about this is that the narrative for months was that black people would be too hesitant to get the vaccine. And it was a big conversation about, you know, Tuskegee and the history of medical experimentation on black people. And I think it was coming from a place of understanding and in a lot of cases. But it just is hilarious because when you look at the numbers, right, the real group of people who are hesitant about getting this groundbreaking medical treatment are right wing Republicans."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,29,"Yeah, I mean, that seems to be the case both in both in the polling and in the focus groups. But it’s also mixed in with a huge jumble of things that make it hard to pull away. So you have the existing anti VAX movement, which existed before we even knew what covid-19 was. You have partisanship, which we’re talking about, and then you also have the general trust in government numbers which are low. And I mean and and then I guess what I would throw in there, I guess this is somewhere in between, which is you don’t have to be a full anti Voxer. I was getting other vaccinations back in September. And the nurse who is giving them to me, I said, boy, I can’t wait for the covid-19 vaccine. And she said, I think maybe I’ve told this story before. She said, wait, you’re going to you’re going to get it. So, I mean, she’s in the biz and she was hesitant. So you jumble all that together. But I think it’s pretty clear. And also our friend of the podcast, Diane Dimond, did a piece in The Washington Post on a Frank Luntz focus group that suggested a lot of these views were politically tinged kind of globally. People don’t trust politicians, but then on the Trump side, were were particularly acute."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,28,"Less scary, I think, in in some black communities. I don’t want to speak for everybody, obviously, but it certainly does not seem to be politicized in the way that it’s been politicized on the right. To the point about Kamala Harris, I think she’s she said if only Donald Trump not mentioned that a public official who supported him, she would, you know, public health official. She would she would get it. But you can see why when there is a president in office. And for some people, look, people think Biden stole the election. You know, there there is a whole kind of there’s a whole fundamental basis behind not trusting or not trusting him as an elected official that does come from Donald Trump."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,29,"And I think one other thing, David, weekend is if that focus group is interesting, it might be because it matches the work that’s been done in deliberative polling, which James Fishkin has been studying at Stanford, which is when you get people together, you give them information from a nonpolitical source. They can in fact, the hardest partisans can get to a kind of more reasoned understanding, which offers a little hope for maybe trickey other issues."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,30,"I am surprised at how much there has been. I think that actually getting police departments nationwide to shift their priorities, change their budgets, that is a decades long project. Right? I mean, I think that we are talking about one of the most entrenched American institutions that exists. It has been one of the most powerful interest groups for over a century. And I think that we are facing a long project of when we are talking the real policy. When you’re talking budgets and talking legislation, when you’re talking local local regulation, that’s a long project. But what you also see is that, I mean, The Washington Post ran a huge op ed just a few days ago called Reimagining Safety, where they say, we’re not saying you should defund all police departments or everything about the police, but yes, we should shift resources from the police to other social services. We should rethink what the police do and how much they need to be involved. That’s massive. Nine months ago, the phrase defund the police was not even something most people had ever considered."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,28,"I always tell a story about a couple of years ago, a hawk, a huge hawk flew into my house in the middle of the day, in the middle of day into the room where I am, flies in to a glass window, shatters the window. A squirrel came into it was and I’m not an animal person, OK? And I freaked out. This was right before Christmas. It was a Friday afternoon. And I called Animal Control. Here I am with like a young child at home. My my mother in law is in a wheelchair. She was with us and I call Animal Control and they’re like, we don’t do birds. Yes, OK. I call the fire department and the fire departments, like the firemen, they do have a husband who can help you."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,30,"I am going to I’m going to listen to this immediately. How has I told this story a million times? I was nobody told me about this American Life episode, so but, you know, it was just such an indication to me. And if you asked most people in the country, they’re going to say, no, the cops should not be showing up for animal control. Right. They shouldn’t be showing up for someone in the midst of an episode of mania. They shouldn’t be showing up in situations where they’re not trained at all to handle those situations. Now, I can imagine a world where we don’t need law enforcement and the way that we currently have it, but not everybody has to get there tomorrow. The fact that it’s in people’s heads, I think is a major, major shift. And I, I worry about the current levels of crime rising because I do think that people draw connections between. Law enforcement and crime and ways that it’s actually not as abstract as we’d like to think it is, but I still think that there’s a shift."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,30,"Well, I can tell you that I think the reason that there isn’t one kind of cohesive reason, or even three, is because crime is complicated. And the fact is that the reason that crime decline has to do with a couple of different things has to do with the fact that people have had better job opportunities, that maybe they’ve been able to put food on their family’s plates, that we’ve had a conversation about social services has to do with after school programs. I mean, a lot of what you’re seeing right now when we talk about crime is coming from young kids and pandemic age who aren’t in school and maybe don’t have I don’t have anything to distract them. It has to do with a change in the way that we consider domestic violence and not just a legal change, because actually we have not gotten much better at handling domestic violence in the legal system. But a social change, a cultural change, it has to do with, you know, access to the Internet and the ability to connect with other people and the ability for ideas to spread. So America is in this kind of very interesting position and has been for the past 30 or let’s say the past 10, 15 years. Right."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,28,"Which is that crime in America is lower than it ever has been. But crime relative to most other countries is high. Right. We have a high level of crime compared to Canada compared to a lot of different places in Europe. We we aren’t as bad as we were, but we could be much better, especially considering the fact that we have the highest incarceration rate in the world. Right. And the fact is that there are countries with very low levels of civilian crime. You can look at Norway or Iceland or, you know, some countries in Eastern Europe where the levels of of crime are actually quite low."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,28,"Or you could look at North Korea. Right. And you can create a world where civilian crime is almost nonexistent if you imprison everybody. And if the you know, if the punishments for doing something very small are very high. But is that the kind of world we want to live in? And that is the real question to me is that we can ensure a safer world, that safer world has to be supported by quality health care, by by jobs, by opportunities for kids and by economic opportunity. These are the things that that that make it less likely that people decide to commit crimes, especially violent crimes."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,29,"Well, I guess I think of it in two ways. One, connecting to our last conversation about vaccine hesitancy. One of the things they’ve learned with that is that public health experts have decided that the best way to get positive information out and have good outcomes is if it’s hyper local, hyper personal and apolitical, which makes me think that’s true of all reform. So so when we rethink public safety, the worst thing that can happen is if the national politicians get involved. That’s the first thing that I think about with the politics of this. The second thing is I’m struck by what we’ve talked about before. What kind of market did Donald Trump create? And he obviously has created a market there for Republicans. But I’ve been struck that Republicans have been talking about Dr. Seuss and immigration, but not doing not picking up what Donald Trump tried to do in the last election, which was basically turn it into a George Wallace Richard Nixon safety in the suburbs campaign. And he tried very hard, remember the Republican convention and it didn’t work. In fact, it turned off a lot of voters, particularly in the in the suburbs."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,31,And and so what I’m curious about is there was obviously then there was a discussion among Democrats after the election about whether saying defund the police actually hurt Democrats in those moderate districts.
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,30,"Yeah, I mean, look, I think that the history of Republican politics and traditionally Democratic politics, too, has been playing to fear and that they will play to fear. Again, it works very often. Right. But in part, the reason it has worked is because they’re always there hasn’t always been an alternative view of what’s possible. And I think about James Foremans book Locking Up Our Own that won the Pulitzer a couple of years ago, where he talks about how in many communities in the late 80s and 90s raped black politicians and and black community leaders wanted more police. They wanted more law enforcement. Right. That was not unusual. The problem is that they also wanted more jobs and they wanted more schools and they wanted more green spaces for their kids to play in. And they wanted early childhood education and they really just got more cops."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,28,"And I think the longer that we try to kind of, you know, project this con onto people where what we’re basically saying is the only way for you to stay safe is for cops to be on every corner. The only way for you to stay safe is for your kid who’s in the throes of a drug addiction to go to jail. The only way for you to stay safe is for when you call the cops on your mentally ill neighbor, you risk them dying. I don’t think those are our choices. That binary is our choice. And so I am sure I’m sure Tom Cotton and Josh Holly and everybody will point to every single, you know, rising crime indication. They will point to black communities and they will say this is what Democrats have done to us. But the truth is that this has been a bipartisan project for decades that has combined with austerity, combined with the welfare queen narrative, combined with a dismissal of public health solutions and combined with the dismissal of the evidence. And hopefully we are seeing people more willing to consider an alternative than just cops."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,30,"You know, we’re facing the biggest infringement, the biggest degradation of voting rights since the 60s. That’s what we’re facing at this exact moment. And it’s actually quite terrifying, I think, for any community. That’s right. To vote has kind of been at risk in the past 40, 50 years. People kind of discuss Donald Trump’s attempts to steal the election and say he was not successful. And I agree he was not successful in winning a second term. He will be successful in imparting fear and doubt and sowing even more mistrust into the voting process. He will be successful at allowing people in bad faith because this is bad faith. People actually no. I mean, people in charge actually know there’s virtually no such thing as voter fraud, certainly not in any way that has shifted elections, voter suppression as a much bigger issue. But they will be successful in many states and making it much, much, much more difficult to vote. That threatens to come again with criminal prosecution here in Georgia."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,30,"In the 2012 election, there was a woman named Olivia Pierson, who is a city councilwoman in Coffee County, which is a southern county, pretty small. She was arrested and forced to face trial twice and faced felonies that could have had her in prison for almost 15 years for working as a poll worker, which she signed up to do. And then when I went, a first time voter came in and asked how the machines worked. She told them she just told them on the machines worked. She didn’t go over there and help them use the machines. She didn’t touch anything. She just said the woman said, how’s the machine work? She told them that apparently wasn’t her role. And then someone almost went to prison for 15 years. I mean, on the second on second trial, she was acquitted. This sort of thing really scares people into not voting. So not only is it hard, but it’s it’s possibly criminal. It creates an environment where what happened in Georgia, here in my home state, due to my county, due to the county right over it, right next to me, will be virtually impossible to happen again."
2,The “I’ll Get the Vaccine If You Give Me a Pony” Edition,31,"People are concerned about fraud because the president was lying about it. And so it is a way in which the president has created think about this for a moment. The president tried to create a commission, the president, his presidential advisory commission on Election Integrity, to look into fraud. The states told him to go pound sand and didn’t give him the data and they couldn’t find any voter fraud and they had to collapse. The thing in twenty eighteen that was such as it was the kind of proper way to try and do this. And they found nothing. So then he told a lie, which has blossomed these efforts across the country among Republicans who want to go, who want to play footsie with his constituency without going fully to January 6th. And so through telling a lie, he has created this market in which now lots and lots of people are playing. And in order to play in the market, they can just say, you know, the people were concerned about fraud. They were concerned about fraud because something was said that wasn’t true. President Trump was much more effective telling a lie than he was setting up a commission. And which is just kind of an extraordinary thing about why this is such an important part of our culture. Look at these efforts and and the arguments being used in support of them."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,32,"I didn’t mean on today’s on today’s show, we’re going to talk about AAFP, the American rescue plan, the most consequential domestic legislation since the Affordable Care Act, which passed Congress. And we will talk about why it is so consequential. Then we will be joined by Heather McGhee to talk about her incredible new book about race and about the American tendency to self-destruction. The book is called The Sum of US. It’s fantastic. And then, is the vaccine rollout going well or poorly? We will check in with Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina about vaccines and also about our old friend testing, which we seem to have forgotten about. Plus, Emily, did you see those funny photos of the lifeguard in Hawaii rescuing Stephen Breyer on his first postretirement vacation when he got caught in the wild surf? You didn’t see those photos? Of course you didn’t, because he has not retired yet, amazingly."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,33,"I know it’s sorry that it has got on and off. The American rescue plan passed the House. Yes, it already passed. The House passed the Senate, passed the House again. Now, when President Biden signs that it will become one of the most consequential pieces of domestic policy legislation in decades, that is because this bill, which was pitched at the covert rescue bill, has been expanded or I guess it was originally it wasn’t expanded because it was his original intent. But it was it was made broad to encompass a variety of largely progressive economic measures that collectively could have a huge impact on poor and middle class Americans, at least in the short term. The average household in the bottom 20 percent of America will see its annual income rise by more than 20 percent. Child poverty in the US will drop by half next year because of this. So, John, what are some of the other elements of this bill that are important but don’t necessarily have a lot to do with covid relief?"
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,34,"Well, I mean, it depends what you know. You can define that differently because you can you know, some people are arguing that the state and local money in the bill doesn’t, strictly speaking, have anything to do with covid relief."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,35,"Of course, the states and and the cities would argue and make and it’s an easy case to make. And actually, the Major Garrett of CBS, who does a podcast called The De-brief, did a great bunch of interviews with mayors that included mayors talking about exactly where the cuts came when revenue went down and spending went up anyway, and just kind of addresses that piece of it nicely. Jason Furman, who worked at the in the Obama administration, who’s been on the show, actually argues that he thinks there was too much money in there for state and local. So it’s not just conservatives or Republicans who are making that case anyway."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,34,"There’s some pension money in the bill that’s basically not related to covid, but to me anyway. The most interesting thing is the child tax credit, which changes. It’s not just the amount that goes to people with children, but it changes the way in which the money is delivered. Under the current scheme, you get a child, you get a tax credit if you have some income against which you can use the credit. This is the new in the new bill. For at least one year, you will get guaranteed money regardless of how much income you have. And it isn’t. And this is something progressives have been pushing for for a long time. And it will be a fascinating experiment. And this is there was a debate with a lot of Republicans arguing that you needed to have some kind of a work requirement and they they didn’t win the day. And it’s going to be it’ll be a fascinating experiment. This is what this is what’s going to lift so many kids out of poverty or that’s what those estimations are based on."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,35,"And there’s been a lot of reporting that the lessons of the stimulus package under the beginning of the Obama administration affected his thinking and his staff and even a lot of Democratic senators that in that if you really want to try and solve the problem, you have to go as big as possible. And big doesn’t just mean dollars. It means I mean, I think the child tax credit fits in the category of build back better, which is we’re not just going to try and solve things to where they were. We’re going to try to institute social policy we believe in. That’s going to make things better. And he was and he’s been saying this during the campaign. I mean, he was the child tax credit was something he talked about during the campaign. So he’s basically doing what he campaigned on. The Tax Policy Center looked at this and is the place that did that ran the numbers behind. What what you’re saying, David, and the FDR quote that I couldn’t remember was from his nineteen thirty seven inauguration in which he said, The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much. It is whether we provide enough for those who have too little. And what strikes me is interesting here is as the president goes out and tries to sell this, which he will now do, Pew Research Center found that about 70 percent of Americans support the bill. When President Trump passed his tax cut in at the end of twenty seventeen polling in early January by Pew showed that thirty seven percent of the country approved of it. It was, and it never got better. So. But you know what I mean?"
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,35,"So to the extent that political parties try to do things that are popular to bring people into their coalition, particularly when they have Senate races up in twenty, twenty two, you want to see things that you do that are popular, bring people into your party. And also when you’re fighting over a certain portion of the electorate, if you look at the polling, again, that Pew polling. Sixty three percent of those who make less than sixty thousand dollars approve of the AARP in the Republican Party. For a president who basically took a partisan approach. Right. Did it all with Democratic votes. Doesn’t seem to have paid any price for that. I think that’s in part because people priced in, nobody cares about bipartisanship anymore. And I also think there’s a big difference between being a partisan and being a partisan and not being a jerk about it, which I think is the route that Biden took. But I think you generally want to do things that have broad public popularity. What’s interesting here is unlike the ACA and the Trump tax bill you have, it’s a much, much more popular piece of legislation that Biden is going out to sell, which may change the political dynamic for its passage."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,32,"So, Emily, there has been essentially no cogent Republican opposition to this bill. They’ve been talking about Pepy Lupu, Dr. Seuss apparently here. We’re not even hearing the kind of classic Paul Ryan fiscal responsibility drumbeat that usually defined the Republican Party in opposition to a Democratic president. Yeah, you are."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,33,"It doesn’t appear to me that there is usually when there’s any Democratic bill, but that cost more than a billion dollars, it’s, oh, we’re bankrupting our children. We’re with this reckless borrowing. And it just like after the Trump years, it’s such a hard argument to make. And it’s not being made with the it just doesn’t appear to me that’s made with the kind of venom or effectiveness that has been made in the past."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,35,"I think that there is something to that. You don’t you also don’t have conservative Democrats supporting that argument. I mean, what hamstrung either actually hamstrung him or in anticipation of it? President Obama and his team knew they couldn’t pass something that was was too big, was conservative Democrats who wouldn’t vote for for too much spending on the argument that it would blow up the deficit. You don’t have that anymore. Really. You that that made it go by faster, too. There’s no question that that Republicans are talking about the debt in a way that’s kind of amusing, given how little they talked about it over the last four years. But it’s more important than that. It’s not that they just didn’t talk about it over the last four years. It’s that Republicans embraced either implicitly or explicitly cockamamie arguments from the economists or the economic team inside the Trump White House about how the tax cuts we’re going to pay for themselves and how they were going to pay for all this other extra spending."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,34,"So it wasn’t just that the temperance leaders allowed drinking. I mean, they rolled in the cash, the kegs. They pretended that what was what was in that red cup was water and not beefeater gin. It’s more than just kind of having been silent. They allowed a total disregard for for deficits over the last four years in a way that makes these current arguments particularly hollow. But it’s not that they’re not making them."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,32,"I’m the the provision I’m most interested in. I’m curious whether this is going to. Take flight is that I think it is that Texas will under this, the AAFP will get more money for Medicaid than is actually being spent on Medicaid. So if they end if there end up being ends up being three billion dollars that the state needs to spend on Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, they were going to would have gotten back, I think, three billion and then 90 percent of three billion. Now they are going to get five billion. So actually going get extra money if they just adopt this Medicaid expansion. And it’s going to be such an interesting test. Will they bother to do this Medicaid expansion, which is not having this Medicaid expansion, killing thousands and thousands of Texans every year? And here’s this chance to do the Medicaid expansion and actually get billions of dollars extra for doing it. And they probably won’t do it."

Go to Slate Dotcom Slugfests Plus to become a member today, Heather McGhee has written to some of us what racism costs everyone and how we can prosper together. It’s a superb new book about race and self-interest and a poisonous, self-destructive tendency in American life in which white people will destroy nice things rather than let black and brown people share them. And this is a book that will that will change the way you look at a lot of issues. So, Heather. Welcome to the Gabfest, I am sorry to make you do this, but when you come up with a great metaphor, you are stuck having to explain it to every new audience that you meet. I know you have done this a million times. Bob Dylan had a Rolling Stone. You have an empty swimming pool. Please explain."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,36,"So I think this is really important. What effective communication both means that the communicator tells their story and that the communicator knows how the audience is going to receive it. Right. What are the frames and filters that the audience has? And so in the some of us identify this zero sum world view, this idea that progress for people of color has to come at white folks expense. A dollar in my pocket means a dollar less than yours. And if that is the world view, then yes, when you talk about racial justice in a way that emphasizes white privilege and talks about what is needed to equalize things for black and brown communities, you do activate that zero sum mindset. And the right wing makes that zero sum story, the breakfast, lunch and dinner of their political messaging. And so you’ve got to recognize that the zero sum is there. But what that doesn’t mean is that the left can afford to skip over race because that worldview is already there."
2,The “Zero Sum” Edition,36,"So even when you talk about things like raising the minimum wage and, you know, supporting families and cancelling student debt, those government programs activate a racialized framework in the white imagination anyway. And so what you have to do is speak to it head on. You have to actually name that zero sum framework, say that it’s wrong, actually say that the right wing is using racial division to divide us and the result is to line the pockets of the wealthy. That’s the political messaging research that we did at Dmoz five years ago that continues to to be relevant today. But the idea is that you can’t skip over race, but you have to talk about the way that racism has a cost for everyone and you have to call it out as a political tool of the plutocrats. And that’s how you marry the sort of class left with the race left. That’s how you do a multiracial populism that leaves particularly white and also, frankly, Latino voters better armed to listen to the right wing and and dispense with their messages even after you’re done talking with them."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,37,"Yeah, I think what what I think what McConnell is trying to do is clear a space on the bus for somebody who is not full Trump. So in other words, let’s say you’re a candidate in one of those states that he’s concerned about. You don’t necessarily, although you’ll be forced to and part of your job in the primary and as a candidate will be kind of ducking these questions. But you don’t necessarily need to come out full bore the way McConnell did. But what he’s saying is there’s a party still represents some attachment to reality. Candidates should still run in that way. And that the hope is that if you build it, a candidate will come, the candidate will have some appeal in the state and that that will get them through the primary and then they’ll be a more valuable general election candidate."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,37,"Well, it’s better than no effort. A, I mean, you’re not going to win in those states by I don’t think and because your most recent example of this is is an election in which both Trump won, they lost the Senate and they didn’t win back the House. The evidence at the moment suggests that it’s not helpful in swing states, a b, the evidence is that he doesn’t convey see great if Mitch McConnell can do away with Donald Trump in some way. But short of that, he needs to be able to try to create some space for a non Trump candidate if he believes, as he has through his career and as most recent evidence would suggest, that the only way you can compete in these states is if you have some candidate that is not objectionable to a broader electorate. The big, big, big, big question is whether that kind of candidate can win a primary, whether you’ve cleared space on the bus or not, whether the primary itself is so locked up by the needs of the Trump market that that’s even possible. But I think that’s generally what he’s trying to do. And we’ll find out. You know, these Republican parties that are centering these senators, those are the ones that are full of the kinds of voters that participate in primaries."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,38,"I mean, that’s a great question. I I guess I feel like they have a tiny shot because of the popularity of the relief bills and, you know, the idea of more infrastructure spending to come, which could also prove popular because Biden seems like such a sort of mild figure as president so far. You, like, kind of barely know he’s there, which is fine with me personally. It’s such a relief or a change. And yet it just seems like how is that ever going to really happen? Because there’s always some wedge issue. There’s always. Some way that people are reminded that they want to stand in some other third place and so what I wonder is you’re really going to end up with is more independent, nonaffiliated voters."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,37,"One thing we should also note here, the funny thing about the McConnell Trump spat is that you can make a pretty strong case that there is no politician or even nonpolitician who did more to get Donald Trump elected and stay in office than Mitch McConnell when he blocked Merrick Garland’s when he blocked Garland’s nomination and created that opening on the on the court. That motivated a lot of voters to vote for Trump, who found him objectionable but knew the courts was important. And then also once he was in office, the way in which McConnell, including the most recent impeachment, managed the impeachment process to close off avenues for witnesses for trying Trump, while he was actually in office, protected Trump considerably. So that should not be lost to the historical record."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,37,"Those voters still want all of those things. They still want identity laden, value laden appeals that are very great, grievance laden appeals that are very Trump like, whether Trump exists or not. And finally, the best way to inject Donald Trump would be on values grounds, on the things that the Republican Party used to use as standards to evaluate public behavior. The problem is they jettisoned all of that to make room for Donald Trump. So all of the talk about character and values that they would have used to attack, say, Bill Clinton, they have changed their mind on all of that and have such a deep record of that that it’s and by the way, it wouldn’t work with those voters anyway, because those voters are the ones that show they didn’t care about it when they were picking their nominee in 2016. So I think those are all reasons why those people can’t eject him or even if they rejected him, they don’t reject the patterns and habits of thought that he’s brought to the fore. In Republican politics."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,38,"I mean, I’m all for putting teachers toward the front of the line, and I’ve been saying that for a while. I think making it a precondition when that’s not what the science bears out is a mistake. And I guess one thing I’m struck by. So my colleague Susan Dominance wrote a good piece about Rhode Island and how the governor there really pushed to open the schools and how in Providence, which has lots of low income people of color, 70 percent of families are black and how they accomplish that. And one thing, the then governor of Rhode Island, Gina Raimondo, who’s now, I think our commerce secretary, if she got confirmed, said was that her what she decided was that she needed to see it go badly to close the schools as opposed to preemptively closing them and then trying to reopen them. And when you look across the country, there are schools open all over the country where, you know, states don’t have as low rates of community spread as the CDC just told us they’re supposed to have and they don’t have everything in place. You just name John. They have masks, which seems to be super important. And I don’t mean to sound cavalier about other safety precautions. I am not. But that is evidence that actually you can do this without adding to community spread."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,38,"It’s not going to be zero risk. You can’t eliminate risk. But when you think of the cost of keeping kids home, I just feel like our whole set of assumptions in some parts of the country, in my view, went off track. And I will say now I am seeing that in my own community. So Connecticut is a state where almost every district has been open and some hybrid or even more fashion since September. It is there’s no evidence it’s added to community spread. But my city, as I’m sure I’ve talked about on the show, kept the schools closed. It was incredibly bitter and divisive. They decided to reopen in the middle of January. At that last meeting before reopening, a chemistry teacher accused the mayor of genocide. And it was really, really heated. There were school board members who absolutely voted against reopening. It said it would be a disaster. We reopened for pre-K through five. A lot of kids didn’t come back because there is a lot of fear, but it’s been fine. And now they’re going to partially reopen the middle schools in a couple of weeks. And I was struck just listening to the last board of that meeting at how people who were against reopening were coming around based on what they could see in front of their eyes. And it’s not that we have low covid in New Haven or Connecticut right now. We don’t we are way over the CDC guidelines. There is this body of evidence on the ground that seems to be sometimes missing from the conversation in very blue parts of the country where there is entrenched opposition. And I find that kind of baffling."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,37,"But know but isn’t the body of science. I mean. So, for example, in schools doing all of the things that are that are recommended, there’s evidence that there’s not community spread but but retaining and having a superintendent of schools and having teachers who are on top of all of that is different than the school in which, I mean, having visited one where it’s all going well, it’s amazing the amount of stuff they have to do to make sure it all continues to go well."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,38,"Right. But soon enough, we’re going to be able to open the windows. Right. And there I mean, the evidence from Rhode Island was that cracking the windows on its own made a difference. So and they have crappy buildings in Providence and they’ve opened safely. And then the second thing is testing. Right. Which can be really complicated and difficult to stand up like. That’s a lot of work to get that all moving. And if you’re going to require that for, you know, weekly for every teacher or even every student, you’re just not going to open the schools the spring."
2,The “Let the Purge Begin” Edition,37,"So and the other thing is obviously contact tracing. So that’s complicated. So you get a call that your student was sitting next to somebody who has been is positive. So now you have to quarantine and your kid has to quarantine, that’s something that exists if you’re doing it right or you’re doing one of the things that the CDC recommends, you’re talking about a major disruption in people’s lives. If they’re doing so, it’s so I mean, there’s one thing is about community spread, but there’s also putting people back in school has knock on effects that that are not just about transmission, is about disruption of lives. Whereas if they’re at home, I mean, obviously this is balancing, right? Because you’re balancing what being at home does psychologically for those kids who feel like their life is taking an irrevocable turn. But going back to school isn’t just about community spread. It’s also about the disruption that happens when you do all the things that the CDC recommends and you find cases and then people have to quarantine for 14 days."
2,The “End This Uncivil War” Edition,40,"There are plenty of people who say, you know, bipartisanship is fine, but we’ve got a lot of work to do, a lot of inequities to fix. We don’t have a willing partner on the other side. So this talk of bipartisanship is tactically unwise and morally a failing. And those are huge hurdles for the centerpiece of the speech, which was to lower the temperature for the purposes of not having a or for ending the uncivil war."
2,The “End This Uncivil War” Edition,40,"You know, there’s a there’s a switch in administrations. There’s a lot of promises about reorienting American government in concert with its values. And then there’s what Emily’s talking about in you, David, as well, which is something that just on minute one is a reorientation, which is to say if America’s goal is to always increase opportunity and equity, having a black woman as vice president just does that immediately. You kind of can’t take that away from from an administration. Just boom. Right. Done. So for those who are looking for hope in an otherwise dark time, when Joe Biden talked about the winter of peril and promise, this would be in the promise category, which has nothing to do with whether Kamala Harris is supports good policies or will be a good vice president or is not full of those complexities that Emily alluded to."
2,The “End This Uncivil War” Edition,39,"Can I say one more thing about the two of them together, which was that I was thinking yesterday, how I’m really glad that Biden’s old in the sense that this is a moment in which there are so many older Americans, older people around the world whose lives are threatened by the pandemic and they’re in this particularly vulnerable category. And so it’s really good to remember, like the value of elder wisdom. And I feel like the fact that Biden has been through all these tragedies in his own life will make him like this is the moment he should be president, even though he’s been thinking about it for 40 years. And then he did this and then he reached for the hand of Kamala Harris and like pulled her forward in the way that Barack Obama pulled him forward. And like, there’s something about that chain that was just it was just moving to me to see."
2,The “End This Uncivil War” Edition,39,"I have no comment about that. So I think that he signaled that he is going to use that pen to undo the kind of obvious moves that Trump made away from the priorities of Democrats in a way from like the sort of traditional world order. Right. So rejoining the Paris climate accord, huge first step undoing the travel ban, the so-called Muslim ban, also really important, saving various domestic agencies from the peril that they’re in. I notice that he revoked Trump’s order that was messing around with the U.S. Census. So there’s obvious moves like that to make. But I think the main thing is going to be spending money. That’s going to be what he is able to do because of the rules that allow Democrats to pass bills with spending implications through reconciliation, which means they don’t have to eliminate the filibuster."
2,The “End This Uncivil War” Edition,39,"And because of the scale of the pandemic, he has really ambitious plans to give people relief, to help people, to help state and local governments, to kind of shore up the country. And I think he will have support to do that. I was also struck by how much he elevated climate as a priority. That just seems to be something that throughout the government they are going to really be talking and doing a lot about. And that also offers spending opportunities because you’re trying to redo our infrastructure to make it sustainable."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,41,"To a lot of people, a vaccine passport sounds great, a piece of paper or an app on your phone that proves you’ve got the Covid vaccine. Just flash it to a maitre d’ or a TSA official or the front desk of a hotel, and bam, you’re in. It’s like your own little ticket to post-pandemic freedom. But what about the billions of people who live in countries with less access to a vaccine? And who exactly has access to that information about your vaccine status? If you care about your data privacy — and you should — maybe you don’t want software companies, and correspondingly, a bunch of businesses you use every day, knowing if you’re vaccinated or not. I’m Jane Coaston. And as of yesterday, I’m fully vaccinated. And I’m as excited as anyone to get back to packed Michigan football games and busy restaurants. But should I need a proof of vaccine to do those things? And who gets to know that I’m vaccinated anyway? My guests today disagree about the risks of vaccine passports. Ramin Bastani is the founder and C.E.O. of Healthvana, a healthcare communications platform. Natalie Kofler is a molecular biologist and bioethicist at Harvard. Natalie, what is a vaccine passport? What does that mean?"
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,42,"I mean, I think, firstly, it’s confusing because there are several names that have been given to this sort of situation, right? So, vaccine passports, vaccine certificates, vaccine certification. And really, the idea is that someone who can show that they have proof of being vaccinated for Covid-19 is then able to move through society in different ways. And so we’re seeing this being thought about in the context, of course, of international travel. So, thinking about being able to enter certain nations on the premise of showing vaccination, but then also kind of merging more into issues of thinking about people who could be employed in certain situations and needing to show a proof of vaccine, and then more widely, sort of distribution of these ideas and thinking about it in its use in the private sector, right? So to be able to go to a concert, maybe go to a hockey game, these sorts of more voluntary, you could kind of call, leisure activities that are, of course, really important to people, but might not be essential things, like work or school or healthcare."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"Yeah, sure. So we actually don’t think of it as a passport at all. We certainly don’t think of it as an immunity passport. We think of this as a medical record. And it’s your personal health record. Some background is helpful. We’ve delivered millions of HIV-related results. HIV is sensitive protected health information. So we have experience in doing this exact kind of work. And prior to the whole conversation around your vaccine record as a part of this, we delivered about 10 million Covid-19 test results to people across the United States. They had used those also to get back to school, to get on a plane, to go back to work, whatever it may be. So we have quite a bit of experience, and we have a very clear point of view that this is your health record. We want to empower you with your health information that, one, you have a right to a copy of it under HIPAA."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"Number two, and incredibly importantly, you can make sure it’s correct. We get so many records that have the wrong date of birth. Maybe it’s set on your phone to internationalization. Your day and month or flipped around. And so we think of this as more of a data problem than anything else. And yes, some people may want to see proof of this for school, for certain employers, perhaps for International travel. But we think this has different layers to it, meaning international travel may have a different subset of rules versus domestic travel, which we don’t think there will be any. Then you have different types of employers that might work in food processing that might require it, versus a law firm which won’t require it at all. They may want to know that you’ve been vaccinated or tested weekly. But it’s going to be about confidence. And so we very much want to empower patients with information at their fingertips. It’s what we’ve done as a company for a number of years."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,41,"Natalie, I want to hear some of your skepticisms because this sounds like the type of information that a lot of people either would want or, in many cases, already have. I got a vaccine card after I was given my first shot, along with arm pain. You use a driver’s license or state ID to cross state lines all the time. Why is this a different issue?"
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"With regards to Covid, we’ve been delivering, again, 10 million plus test results across the country. It’s a similar situation where people do have access to go get tests in some cases and in most cases. What I can tell you with I think what you’re describing is the digital divide potentially, 97% of people who have used Healthvana are able to view the results in the first day. It doesn’t have to be a smartphone. But most people have text on their phone. So what we’ve made sure to do is to make sure that it doesn’t have to be a smartphone. You can use a desktop. We’re available in multiple languages. We’re working with very large testing sites in a way to help them manage their populations. And if you don’t have a smartphone, you can then get the email and then print it up at home. With regards to the vaccination card, we think this is better than a piece of paper. We’ve seen so many — I mean, we have emails about this, where people are like, it says I got Pfizer, but I actually got Moderna."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"It doesn’t have all my information. My name is misspelled. What if I have to use this thing? So we’re very much focused on that first order problem of getting information to patients in a digital way, so they don’t have to necessarily laminate it. And that becomes incredibly important because there’s going to be booster shots coming. And we can then remind hundreds of thousands, millions of people that there’s a booster available for Moderna. If you’re of this age, that might be relevant."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,41,"I am sure that you are a delightful human being and your company is full of delightful human beings. But tech companies are often run by delightful human beings with security lapses, which can happen to virtually any company. So that piece of paper I have that could have my weird misspelled name, I know exactly where it is. I am looking at the drawer that it is inside. I do not know where you or your company will keep this information. So for people who are older or paranoid, or old and paranoid, why should they trust a tech company, when literally having that piece of paper, I think, for many people, including me, is very reassuring?"
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"They don’t have to. They can opt out of it. Or they’re opting into it. So when you’re registering, you’re opting in to receiving a digital version of this by email or by text. Now it’s not coming in the email or the body of the text. You click on the link, you enter your first name, last name, and your date of birth, and within 15 seconds, you have access to a digital record. You can then take a screenshot of it. There’s different ways to do this, but it’s an option that goes beyond a piece of paper. And with regards to security, we’ve been doing this for a while. And we’re securing at the same place hospitals keep their kinds of information in Amazon Web Services. So we take a lot of the different measures that are necessary for a company like us."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,42,"The way that this is sort of looking from a legal standpoint is that it does look like at this point, for private actors — companies, airlines, Ticketmaster, Delta, those sorts of folks, the NBA — if they wanted to implement sort of a requirement to use their services, there doesn’t seem to be any sort of oversight that would prevent that from happening, right? There’s a lot of impetus to think about providing a sense of security to your patrons or to your customers that say we can guarantee if you’re going to take this flight on American that every adult will be vaccinated, right?"
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,42,"And so then you see that as being like, OK, then you have to use some sort of form of validating your vaccine status, which could likely include some sort of smartphone app or paper validation to then get on that American Airlines flight. This is where the privacy issue gets — I get concerned about because now American Airlines has access to information about your health, right? And what level of information are they being given? And not even to point it at airlines, I mean, it could be like literally your local Italian restaurant down the street, too."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,41,"That Israel example is particularly interesting because I was thinking that perhaps having a Covid passport would give you a false sense of security because you would have — presumably, for instance, I have the Pfizer shot. But there are additional Covid variants that are emerging. And as Ramin mentioned, you might need a booster shot. Is there a concern for you what people interpret the Covid passport as meaning might put them at risk?"
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"Yeah, we think of this domestically more than anything else. There is a couple of vaccines that are pretty effective. And hopefully, people do want to get the vaccination. But a lot of people won’t for all sorts of reasons. And that’s their right. So I guess a lot of the times, we think of it as three different ways that you can get back to whatever that normal may be for you. And again, that’s really important that it’s up to that person or if their employer requires it if that’s a part of their job, but one is showing some proof of your vaccination. Second is going to be a negative PCR test. And third will be showing an antibody test to show that maybe you’ve had a recent infection or that you have some level of antibodies or immunity through the vaccination. I think my guess is about a fifth of the country won’t get vaccinated. You look at different numbers. There’s already people saying there’s all sorts of reasons why they don’t want to do it. And it’s become a political issue, in some ways. And as things change, to your question, we’ll iterate along with it. We act as that last mile. We’re able to deliver that information to people in a way that they can have at their fingertips that enables them, empowers them to go about their life in the way they want."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,41,"So there is obviously a ethical concern with vaccine passports here. Because I think that there is obviously the, what if the government demands I show this to do something or to cross state lines. But we’re very quickly going to see private companies saying, you can’t come to this restaurant or kind of making it the no shirt, no shoes, no service argument."
3,The Reality of Vaccine Passports,43,"It’s because of our work in HIV that formed the way we think about this. And it’s the almost identical thing in that you have a right to your information. It has to be a correct amount of information. And that information can be used by you to maybe get a second opinion, another doctor. Even in the work that we do within HIV, which includes your sexual health and STIs and then also hepatitis, a lot of people use Healthvana to actually screenshot their results, whether HIV positive and showing they take their medication. And so people actually put them on dating sites. It’s up to them to share what they want. And that happens a lot. People are doing the exact same thing with Covid where we put it in a way they could screenshot it and share it, if they wanted, with family. Especially if they test positive, they can tell other people to actually get tested right away. In the HIV world, it’s called partner notification, if you test positive and you have disease, investigation specialists that come to you and do contact tracing. So it’s also why we’ve been able to jump so quickly into doing a lot of work with Covid and have had such a good impact so quickly in our view."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,44,"There is a criminal justice or a legal element to what you’re required to prove it, but there is also a broader conversation and a broader discussion about actions that have an impact that goes beyond the individual victim and affects society. And I think we all know that you can’t legislate hate away. There’s no magic wand to make it disappear. And hate crime laws are basically one tool, one tool in a toolbox that has to also include education and community response and all those kinds of factors. And the fact that the law is there is, it’s one more way to show as a society that we think these crimes need to be taken seriously, need to be addressed seriously because of the impact that they have."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,45,"Absolutely. And what you experience is something that people of historically marginalized groups will experience when someone that they can identify with, who they share a similar marginalized identity with, goes through something that’s violent or even is killed by something that’s violent. And this concept is called historical trauma. It’s sometimes referred to as collective trauma. And it’s the idea that people may feel and experience trauma symptoms and reactions to incidents that they aren’t directly related to. So research on trauma has found in general that survivors of trauma, whether it be war survivors, sexual assault survivors, hate crime violence survivors, will experience lots of symptoms ranging from difficulty functioning, jitteriness, fear, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, intrusive thoughts, et cetera, et cetera. And it’s something that you could see cuts across every group. So when Black people are killed by police officers, Black people across the country, across the world, may feel a visceral reaction to seeing the event particularly, now that things are being video recorded, or even just hearing about those things."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,45,"Because you imagine, this could have been me, this could have been my brother, or this could have been my cousin, et cetera. And even for this past month with the shootings in Atlanta for Asian-American people, they might experience that as well. So, yes, hate crimes do send a negative message to people and communities who experience them. The closer you are to that person’s identity groups or the more similarities you have, that might also influence how much of an effect it has on you. It does cause even terror in the community, right? And so that’s another thing that I don’t know if we’re going to talk about today. But the relationship between domestic terrorism and hate crime law and how things might be classified as one or both and oftentimes are not if it involves anything related to racism."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,44,"It’s always better to prevent crimes, right? Criminal laws don’t prevent crimes. It’s too narrow a prism to look through. I think you have to look at law and education and leadership and helplines, crisis counseling, various kinds of examples that in a sort of a big picture of how we respond to hate. You’re not going to be able to prove a negative. You’re not going to be able to say criminal laws don’t prevent crimes because it’s really hard in the sense of it sort of proving a negative. But I think more broadly, the impact is measured by looking at the way legislatures have reacted, the way that law enforcement officers have reacted. And we’ve talked about fighting hate, and we’ve seen police departments, we’ve seen district attorney’s offices, we’ve seen legislatures, we’ve seen plenty of different forms where just understanding the concern has led to more effective action, I guess."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,44,"When we started working on hate crime laws 40 years ago, people didn’t understand the concept that a certain kind of crime could have a greater impact. And over time, it became a very common and understood thing so that people said, you talk about a hate crime and they understood that was targeting somebody because of who they are. And there was widespread acceptance that it was a bad thing. So I’m not really sure how to answer the question of how effective they are because it’s like proving, as I said before, proving a negative. How effective is a murder law? How effective is a rape law? How effective is a burglary law? You’re still going to have murders."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,44,"You’re still going to have rapes. And you’re still going to have burglaries. But part of it is making sure that we have the tools to assess them. There’s legislation pending now in Congress called the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer NO HATE Act that we are supporting and really help address that question because it talks about grants to promote hate crime training and prevention and best practices and data collection initiatives, all of which go to legislative understanding that this is important. It’s important to have a handle on it. It’s important to decide how big a problem it is so we can allocate the appropriate resources necessary to address it. When we worked on the initial case in 1993, as a remarkable accomplishment we were really proud of was that the attorney generals of the other 49 states joined in one amicus brief supporting Wisconsin and its law. And that doesn’t happen very often. When we worked on the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Federal Hate Crime Prevention Act, we led a coalition of over 200 organizations — civil society groups, and law enforcement agencies — all of which underscored the importance of the hate crimes law. So I think that it just sort of by virtue of the widespread support it had, it showed by itself that this was something that people thought was important."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,45,"You know, it’s interesting that you say that because I think I generally do support hate crime laws. I just want them to be used effectively, right? I’m a queer person of color. I can be targeted by a hate crime in any day of my life. It’s a heightened sense, especially for me now as an Asian-American walking down the street, even though a lot of times people don’t read me as an Asian-American, so I feel safe in some ways because of that. And I also have the knowledge in knowing that the criminal justice system is disproportionately overrepresented with Black and Brown people and that a lot of times, the people that do get charged with hate crimes are Black and Brown people, which then increases that number, and that a lot of white people who engage in hate crimes or commit hate crimes actually don’t get charged. I mean, I think it’s so important for us to acknowledge other major events throughout history, like for example, the 2016 Orlando Pulse shootings that the F.B.I. deemed as not being a hate crime because the perpetrator did not demonstrate enough information that he was anti-gay or anti-LGBTQ or anti-Latinx, even though it was specifically Latinx night and that majority of the victims who were killed were queer Latinx and Puerto Rican people specifically, which the media oftentimes overlooks."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,44,"There’s a lot there, and it’s a really, really important question. There is a legal piece, and there’s a broader societal or communal piece. Whether a situation meets the legal standard for beyond a reasonable doubt to prove a case is only one question. How you describe a crime may not necessarily be exactly the same in the public arena in the court of public opinion as it is in a court of law. The prosecutor making out a case has to show specific elements to satisfy the jury. And they have to show the underlying crime. And they have to show this selection or the targeting. But it’s perfectly understandable and reasonable to talk more broadly about the kind of impact that crimes have. And I think it’s a legitimate distinction to make beyond the individual situation. It’s also important to talk more broadly about crimes, crime reporting, the number of crimes where the witness— there’s a witness or a victim who is reluctant to come forward. And in fact, it’s a hate crime, but it never goes reported as a hate crime."
3,What’s Wrong With Our Hate Crime Laws?,44,"Or it’s a jurisdiction which this is not accepting that there aren’t hate crimes reported. I mean, it’s a little crazy, but there are cities in this country that reported no hate crimes whatsoever in 2019. It just is not credible. It’s important to have an understanding more broadly that these crimes are probably motivated by hate, even if you can’t prove it, while at the same time, in a court holding to the legal standard because to satisfy constitutionality, you have to be able to show — otherwise, you run into free speech problems. Otherwise, you say you’re punishing somebody’s thoughts unless you can show a direct connection between the intent and the selection. You run into some legal problems."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,46,"The New York Times has written about some of these, right, of cases of past social media use coming back to haunt people and them suffering, firing, or not being able to go to the college they intended to go to anymore or social stigma, or sometimes harassment and death threats. This whole conversation borders just the general online harassment conversation. And that is a cultural phenomenon, and that’s what we’re describing. And yeah, I do think it’s bad. I think there’s something to it. Obviously, sometimes people deserve this, but a lot of times, they don’t. Or a lot of times, they deserved a, hey, you were wrong. That was bad. You should apologize. Not, and now your life is coming to an end."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,46,"But I do think what is the job that just a person who’s kind of a kook is allowed to have? No job? They should be homeless? They should be poverty stricken? Obviously, you can go to the extreme, yes, virulent, awful Nazis. No one wants them to have jobs, although there’s a lot of people out in America, not who are Nazis, but who have kooky political ideas, the ideas that just kind of normal Americans have who are not in the professional ideas and takes having class. Their ideas are kind of awful on all sides of the political spectrum. And I’m worried that many of the phenomena Will just described that he also is concerned about, the ability to monitor people through social media or to record or keep a record of the dumb, wrong, vaguely offensive or kooky things everyone has said because everyone has always kind of had these problematic kooky views — not everyone but a lot of people — now we can hold them accountable for it. It would be more important, I think, to have some kind of separation between people and their bad political ideas, or to have some norm that you’re not going to be fired or expelled or whatever for having a really dumb political opinion, because everyone has really dumb political opinions. And what people get outraged about is pretty selective, but there’s always something that can outrage someone."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,47,"Yeah, I think that is a lot of it. And that’s part of my problem with the broad brush of cancel culture. I mean, there have been generations of efforts from people of historically subordinated and marginalized groups. They’ve been trying hard for a long time to get their rights recognized and their interests recognized. And once some of those basics were put in place, then the project kind of moved toward establishing some new norms of speech and public behavior that affords them the dignity and respect that’s owed to social and political equals. I mean, I think that’s a very worthy project. But any time you’re trying to change the norms, there’s always going to be conflict. It’s just inevitable. People get used to doing things one way. They don’t like to change, and they certainly don’t like to face sanctions for doing things that didn’t come with any consequences in the past."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,47,"I think it’s harmful to conflate that worthy project, confusing the struggle for more respectful egalitarian norms with some sort of ideological project of socially enforced conformity, an assault on freedom of conscience and speech. I just don’t think that’s helpful. So I think it’s 100% the case that as groups gain economic and political power, as they start reaping the rewards of advances in equality, that people are going to use their new leverage, use their heft to change the culture. And I don’t think it’s tyrannical for people to do that."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,46,"But it’s often taken exactly the form of — I mean, tyranny is a kind of hyperbolic way to frame it, but of sanction and punishment. You can find examples of this, many of them on elite college campuses, where not most students, not most young people, not most people of color or trans people or gay people, but a small subset of activists on behalf of these issues, using the kind of changing cultural norms to punish sometimes other students, often their own professors, often their own very liberal far-left professors who have slightly different ideas about what words are supposed to be used. And that is happening in college classrooms all the time, where, again, not because it’s most people, not even most young people or most liberal people or most progressive activists, but a small number of very easily offended people now have tremendous power, not in our whole country, not in the government, but in small, elite circles, like Twitter to some degree. I find it very concerning."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,47,"Yeah, I mean, here in Iowa, the Republican majority legislature has introduced a bill to make it illegal for public schools and public universities to teach things out of the 1619 Project. I find that concerning. With the case about the universities, my focus is on trying to identify where the real problem is. It’s not to deny that there are real problems. But a lot of these problems in universities are, I think, a function of breakdowns of university administration, where they’ve become so risk averse that anybody can be violating some sort of administrative rule at any time, that that’s really easily weaponized."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,47,"But I’m not sure that that specific problem is a problem with an over censorious climate of speech, just like I’m not sure that mobs on Twitter are a cultural problem that has to do with increasing intolerance of a diversity of views, so much as it has to do with the incentives that are built into the business models of these kind of platforms. Maybe there’s problems with the way these businesses are structured such that they are trying to sell our data in a way, trying to advertise to us in a way that makes them depend on engagement, makes it in their interest to incentivize polarization, a kind of bitter antagonism. I’m just not sure that that’s not the problem, as opposed to some diffuse cultural shift toward intolerance and hostility to people with opposing views."
3,Is It Time to Cancel Cancel Culture?,46,"This is something you hear from a lot of people. Why do you care so much about x thing and not y thing? But then it becomes a little bit of like, well, just because I write about x thing doesn’t mean that’s the thing I care about most. I’m, for better or worse, a culture writer. And I’m interested in these things. I think they are important. And I try in my writing not to make broad generalizations like that this is the worst thing ever or that this is such a clear phenomenon that — because this is a difficult thing to quantify or qualify that we’re talking about. I did not choose the term “cancel culture” and probably wouldn’t if I could magically force everyone to talk about these issues because it is imprecise, and it is wielded in very unhelpful ways by many people, including Republican officials, who have described everything from the impeachment of Donald Trump and the revelations about things Marjorie Taylor Green has said in the past as cancel culture."
3,"To Fight Poverty, Raise the Minimum Wage? Or Abolish It?",48,"So I think it’s important to understand the full scope of what’s being proposed. The Raise the Wage Act not only would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over several years, but it would also eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, which is literally a legacy of slavery, the sub-minimum wage for workers with disabilities, which is a direct reflection of the valuation of people with disabilities, and youth. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 for all workers and $2.13 an hour for tipped workers, and it is cents — literally less than $1 — for workers with disabilities. Our position is, of course, that that is not just low, it actually creates severe poverty, economic instability. It has created just horrific suffering during the pandemic."
3,"To Fight Poverty, Raise the Minimum Wage? Or Abolish It?",48,"With — in the case of the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, it’s also been a source of horrific sexual harassment because you have a largely female workforce living off of tips as a portion of their base wage, and that $15 is actually the minimum that’s necessary to live, particularly given that this workforce of minimum wage workers are adults. Median age is in the 30s. They have children, and they are struggling to survive, often working multiple jobs on these poverty wages. So we strongly support phasing in the raise of the minimum wage over time."
3,"To Fight Poverty, Raise the Minimum Wage? Or Abolish It?",48,"You know, the press reported on that Congressional Budget Office report in a way that, I think, caused most people not to actually read the report. The actual CBO report, what it said is that we don’t know what the impact on jobs could be. The impact on jobs could actually be anywhere from 0 to close to 3 million jobs. We have no idea. And that 1.4 million number was an intermediate between zero and close to three. In fact, we looked at the seven states that require what we call one fair wage, a full minimum wage with tips on top, including California, which has passed a $15 minimum wage and full elimination of the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers. Those seven states — and by the way, they’re not all blue states. If you look at those states that have raised the minimum wage, those seven states, in particular for the restaurant industry — we looked at from 2011 to 2016 — we saw that those states actually had higher job growth rates in the restaurant industry."
3,"To Fight Poverty, Raise the Minimum Wage? Or Abolish It?",49,"So a negative income tax, which is, in all important ways, the same as a universal basic income, says that everybody is guaranteed a certain amount of income per quarter or per year, some basis like that. And then they face some tax rate on all income earned. The simplest way to describe it, which doesn’t feel right to many people, is to say we send a check for $5,000 to every single person, including Bill Gates and, you know, Warren Buffett, but we then impose taxes. So if you have no income of your own, you receive that $5,000 per year, and that’s your total net income."
3,"To Fight Poverty, Raise the Minimum Wage? Or Abolish It?",49,"It’s basically a practical answer that if the government does it in roughly the way I described, it’s consistent. It applies to everyone. It happens sort of year after year after year because it’s a government policy that’s in place and it continues, unless Congress changes its mind. But trying to get private employers to do it ends up mainly enriching private employers or some sectors relative to others. The housing industry gets richer than it would otherwise be because the government is subsidizing the building of housing projects. Certain farmers get richer than they would otherwise be because the government subsidizes food stamps."
3,"To Fight Poverty, Raise the Minimum Wage? Or Abolish It?",49,"The transferring income to people approach doesn’t create any special favors for this industry versus that. It doesn’t allow you to go to Washington and lobby them to produce the — more of the goods and services that your industry produces because that’s allegedly helping poor people. It avoids all the inefficiencies created by having a centrally planned — central planner dictate what’s produced and how firms behave. If I could go back to one thing that Saru said, she said several times, we agreed, when we ended slavery, that we owe everyone a fair wage."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,50,"Right. I mean, I would say that a lot of that is rooted in what Ross described as this consensus politics out of the 1990s. There was this amazingly politically successful move by traditional labor or center-left parties to move further to the center and move towards what we call in America wine-track voters and kind of college graduates, upwardly mobile whites that are moving back into the major metropolitan areas. And that that group that was kind of added to the Democratic Party in the United States is overserved by our current politics and our current political consensus. And so normal people might be someone who goes to state university and returns home and ends up starting a small business, working just as a wage earner in a nonglobalized city."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,51,"But then the worst case is, yeah, that you just get into scapegoating sort of the weaker parties in this new landscape, which means that you just scapegoat immigrants who are obviously part of the new economy, but you scapegoat them rather than addressing or attacking the actual big winners of this new environment. That would be one way this just turns into and does and has in the Trump era into just a kind of scapegoating that doesn’t actually, as the kids say, speak truth to power."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,50,"Well, and you see this in the rhetoric of even Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri, talks about the great middle. And in a sense, he’s identifying in the great American middle maybe this idea of a middle-class life that is more self-sufficient where people watch their own kids, clean their own house, probably have less food delivery and go to restaurants less maybe. And that’s pitched both against those up and against those down from the middle."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,51,"But this is the nature of populism is that in order to be politically effective, it needs to recruit class traitors. There are lots of critiques of Hawley, reasonable critiques especially since the events of January 6 in D.C. But the fact that he is an Ivy League-trained elite who is presenting himself as a champion of the forgotten American middle strikes me as not just a cheap shot but just not understanding what populism has to do in order to be successul. It needs people from within the elite to act on behalf of people outside of the elite. And the fact that they have fancy Ivy League degrees or whatever, it’s a feature, not a bug. So I’m all for fancy lawyers from the big city being populists. And, I mean, obviously there’s some self-interest here in that I am an Ivy League educated would-be populist too."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,50,"Oh yeah. I’ve wanted to see this kind of politics emerge and actually was doubtful that it ever would come around in America. But I started to notice it overseas in Europe, that the Tory Party in the U.K. was starting to draw more and find more opportunity in traditional Labour heartlands. There were hints of it in the G.O.P. Mitt Romney in 2012 took a slightly more confrontational stance against China. He kind of defendant himself against Rick Perry from the left on some social spending issues but then from the right on immigration. Rick Santorum was questioning some trade policies and their effect on the American middle class and family."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,50,"So I thought this politics was possible, and I thought it was a reaction to that broad Western center-left consensus of the ‘90s, and finally the reaction to that politics was happening. And this reaction was, in some way, inevitable and that this populist nationalist suite of issues was going to be a feature of our politics in some way after Trump and that it was what distinguished him so much from the field. It wasn’t just his celebrity. It was also this suite of issues and attitudes, not all of which he took into governance, to be sure."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,51,"I would say Trumpism was populism, and now it’s a little more unclear. I think that what you saw in 2016 was Trump ran a campaign along multiple dimensions, but a core theme of his campaign was the idea that there was this two-party consensus on a bunch of issues — trade, immigration, globalization — that was bad for the American middle, the American worker, and he was going to fix that. And that meant everything from trade wars with China to building the wall on the Mexican border to spending lots more money on infrastructure."
3,‘Vandalism With a Purpose’ and the Future of the G.O.P.,51,"It’s to build a populism that doesn’t make people who are not, in fact, elites feel like they’re being scapegoated all the time but that does, in fact, punish the people in charge by removing them from power, at the very least, when they preside over a bunch of disasters."
3,‘I’ve Never Hated Anything as Much as I Hate This’,52,"Well, I mean, it feels like it keeps getting further and further out of reach, right? Especially with the nightmare of the new variants. There’s public health experts, I think, who are frustrated by the public health guidance. I do feel like every time somebody kind of starts saying, oh, once I get the vaccine, I’m going to — whatever they’re going to do, have a party — somebody pops up to say, you’re going to keep wearing your mask and social distancing. That’s what you’re going to do. And it really makes me furious. First of all, it does make sense that you can’t just get your vaccine and then sort of go back to normal in a world where most other people don’t have it. I understand that. And I’ve got to think that the people who are giving this advice understand how hellish this mode of living is."
3,‘I’ve Never Hated Anything as Much as I Hate This’,52,"I don’t really know where this kind of attitude, which, again, I don’t think is coming from all public health experts, but is coming from enough of them that you get all these headlines about, don’t even think about taking off your mask after you’ve been vaccinated. And I think that a lot of the anger it generates could be mitigated by just an acknowledgment of how horrible this is for people, right? And not kind of being sort of blithe about, yes, you’re going to have to continue social distancing, as opposed to, yes, you’re going to have to hang on, even though this is excruciating, even though this is miserable. You just have to hang on for a few more months."
3,‘I’ve Never Hated Anything as Much as I Hate This’,52,"And again, maybe people’s empathy deservedly goes to their colleagues who are in overrun hospitals and the people who end up in those hospitals. And there’s sort of less empathy for people who are suffering in comfort. And I guess, that makes sense. Although there’s also something interesting, I think, which is that there’s been this reversal of the political polarities around mental health. Progressives, who traditionally are extremely attentive to trauma and who sort of, if somebody claims to be traumatized, to be suffering sort of psychological devastation, are pretty sensitive to that. And you have a right that’s like, suck it up, buttercup. And now, all of a sudden, you have a right that is constantly talking about people feeling depressed and suicidal. And I understand why progressives are a little bit skeptical of that because people who have not traditionally been super sensitive to mental health challenges in the past."
3,What Happens if Trump Doesn’t Concede?,53,"I think that the polling error this time, just in terms of the difference between the actual results and what the pre-election polls found, is almost exactly identical to the miss in 2016. But given that pollsters took a number of steps that we know improved the president’s standing in those surveys, the polling miss is, to my mind, a deeper and more significant miss than the one in 2016. And so I think we have to ask, why did the underlying data, the responses that we get to these surveys, get so much worse over the last four years that it canceled out whatever gains pollsters made by adjusting their samples in ways that led to a more conservative electorate? And I think there are four basic possibilities."
3,What Happens if Trump Doesn’t Concede?,53,"One is that Trump supporters became less likely to respond to surveys, controlling for their demographic characteristics. The president attacked the media and the polling industry for years. The 2016 election result itself could have diminished trust in surveys. And all of this might have led to a decrease in the propensity for Republican-leaning voters to participate in the polls. A second possibility is sort of the flip side of that, that maybe progressives became more likely to respond to polls. We saw this huge uptick in political participation on the left over the last few years, the millions of dollars going to special elections and long shot candidates."
3,What Happens if Trump Doesn’t Concede?,53,"I think that most polls found that that increase in turnout would be to the benefit of the Democrats and Joe Biden, because nonvoters in 2016 were disproportionately Democratic. I think it is quite possible that in the final account we’ll find that that was not true, that a disproportionate number of the new voters in this election were Republicans or Republican-leaning voters who came out to back the president’s re-election. And I don’t think that would — if that’s true, and unlike some of the other theories, that’ll be very easy to validate, that would not have been reflected by the pre-election polling this year."
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,54,"I’ve wanted to kill the filibuster since I began reporting on the Senate in earnest. I came to Washington in 2005 and began doing Congressional reporting about then. And I was pretty down on the filibuster pretty quickly after that. If the filibuster did what it says on the tin, I would not want to kill the filibuster. If it increased deliberation in the Senate, I would be for it. But it does not — it impedes deliberation in the Senate. If it increased compromise, I might be for it. But it does not — it impedes compromise, and at the very least makes full-on obstruction more likely than compromise. The issue I have with the filibuster is not that there should not be a way for the minority to make sure its voice is heard, not even to ensure things are slowed down and considered, it’s that the way I believe a system like ours, a political system like ours, should run — the way it was intended to run by the founding fathers is that the American people should vote in a political party, that political party should pass some rough facsimile of the agenda they promised the American people, they should be critiqued by the opposition party, and then the public should decide, the voters should decide, did that agenda work?"
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,54,"Do they want to return those people to office, or do they want to kick them out of office and give the other side a try? Instead, what we have happen is the public votes in a party. That party may or may not win power, depending on the electoral college and the geography of the Senate — but put that aside for a minute. Then that party comes into power, they don’t pass very much of their agenda at all. The public does not understand why the problems keep going unsolved, but the opposition party runs against whoever’s in power as not doing a good job. And basically, you end up in this endless fight over accountability. And there’s this huge fog over who to blame for why people’s problems keep festering. And so my core principle here is that politicians should be accountable to the public. When you strangle so much legislating in opaque Senate rules, and you create such bad incentives, frankly, for compromise, I think you rob the public of the ability to attach clear accountability to outcomes, and thus you rob them of their power over the political system."
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,55,"But when you look at the last 20 years when Republicans were in power or when Democrats were in power, they got big pieces of their legislative agenda through in spite of the filibuster being there, and because of the filibuster being there, allowing for more consensus, more debate, more conversation, more checks and balances. The reality is, this is the kind of stuff that ensures we have some sense of checks and balances with a very polarizing country, and especially today when we’re dealing with such deep, divisive issues. I would rather people come to consensus."
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,54,"We can have a whole conversation about whether or not the filibuster encourages deliberation. I think it’s very clear at this point it does not. Filibusters have nothing to do and do not currently include people talking on the floor of the Senate for the most part. But putting that aside, the real question is the 51 versus 60-vote question. Because we could have all kinds of ways to ensure lengthy debate processes that don’t include a 60-vote supermajority. So then we should just get at that directly. Does it make more sense to have majorities pass legislation, or should you always require supermajorities in order to do so?"
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,55,"So I think it goes back to the very principle of a judicial nominee that makes up the judicial branch versus those pieces of legislation that keep the government open. So I actually don’t have a problem with 51 votes to keep the government open with a budget or spending bill. I have a problem with 51 votes to have fundamental social and socioeconomic changes that are part of the cultural agenda — whether that’s court-packing, or amnesty, immigration, gun control, Second Amendment, minimum wage — all of that is kind of in this social space is a different type of conversation, I think, for the Senate to deliberate, because it impacts the social side of, frankly, the country as opposed to simply trying to keep the government open and ensure that the government works, which is what comes down to the vote of 51. And I think you can have a conversation, is it 51 or 52? Or is it 50?"
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,55,"That ends up becoming, I think, in a large way, arbitrary. But what I think matters is that the filibuster prevents 51% of the country from overcoming and then running the lives of 100% of the country. So I agree with a lot of Ezra’s opening comments that we want the people to be able to hold our elected officials accountable. We want them to be clean and clear lines of accountability. I think we all want that. We strive for that. But I don’t see how the filibuster prohibits that. I think if anything, it allows more senators to have more debate, get on the record about more issues, like these policy issues that are at the cultural, social level that are worth the discussion before they move forward. So to me, it’s a fundamental"
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,54,"For instance, Obamacare was not just budget and spending. It’s a lot of different things. I’ll give an example this — in the current fiscal rescue package that the Biden administration is trying to put forward, something you could do through budget reconciliation is triple the size of the child tax credit. Something you cannot do through budget reconciliation is emergency paid leave. I do not see myself an obvious sociocultural difference between allowing emergency pay leave and a child tax credit during a pandemic emergency. Do you? Is there some reason emergency pay leave should have a 60-vote threshold, but tripling the child tax credit, or sending out $1,400 checks, or any of these other things should not?"
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,55,"Well, I think that gets to the exact question that we’re having here, which is, what is the difference of the impact? And if you look at the difference of the impact of tax credits — which is less dollars that are taken away, and essentially your money that you get to keep without a higher burden of tax — that’s different than an additional spending bill that’s put on top. And so is it splitting hairs? Do the parlertarians and the parles have a very difficult decision to split hairs between the two? Yeah, but I think that’s exactly what the Senate process is supposed to really uncover."
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,54,"I think you just answered it — it’s the judiciary. I mean, it just is. The judiciary is a separate branch of government and has a separate line when it comes to checks and balances. And at the end of the day, the Noms argument to keep the judicial branch in place is the only way you would have a judicial branch. Otherwise, would we even have one?"
3,Should We Put the Filibuster Out of Its Misery?,55,"Look, until a couple of years ago, we had judicial nominees under the filibuster as well. Every argument that is being made here on this show to keep the legislative filibuster was made to keep the judicial filibuster. But I do want to respond to something that Jessica said earlier about not allowing 51% of the country to make these huge decisions. There are two things that are worth noting here, one is that the Senate is very unusually structured, such as it already has quite a lot of disproportionate impact embedded within it. So the 50 Democratic senators represent 41 million more people than the 50 Republican senators. We’re dealing with a situation here where the Senate is already giving a pretty big handicap to the Republican side at this point, between 3 and 7 points, depending on different estimates I’ve seen. And then you add the filibuster supermajority requirement on top of already the Senate’s equal branch requirement. This is just not how the place was meant to work — not for judges, not for anything, but a couple of things which in the Constitution are specifically given supermajorities, like conviction for impeachment, certain kinds of foreign deals, et cetera."
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"So since the election, to an extraordinary degree, the infighting between moderates and the progressive wing of the party has spilled out into public view. Democrats have been arguing what went wrong on Election Day. There was no blue wave. They, at least so far, have not captured a Senate majority. So what does the party do to course correct now? How does it do it? One of the voices championing the progressive agenda most brilliantly in Congress is Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. She is the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, and she is joining us from Seattle. I want to start, actually, with this question. What is your theory of the case? What happened?"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,57,"Well, I think the first thing is that I went to sleep the night before the election thinking job number one was to get Donald Trump out of the White House. And I really think that that is where everybody’s head was. And of course, we hoped to gain more seats in the House. We didn’t. And we had hoped to take over the Senate, but I will tell you that, for me, I thought that was going to be very, very tough. And so when I look at this moment, what I think we have to recognize is Joe Biden is the first president to win both the popular vote and the electoral college vote in a long time. Now, we have to assume a few things. Number one, the country is very divided, and running a state race or a presidential race is different than running a district race."
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,57,"There’s no question about that. Number two, that the Democratic Party has, for a long time, not had people voting that should have been voting that are naturally part of our base. And there are a long list of factors that we can go into as to why that is, but we should recognize that we were finally successful in turning out people that I would not call base voters. And then the third is, I think about— and I was just rereading some speeches from Dr. King in the ‘60s. And I think about the ways in which the system has really been stacked. And sometimes our desire for what Dr. King called order over justice has actually compromised our ability to win not only in the short term, but in the long term. And I think that’s a very complex set of conditions that exist, but I think that we have to dive into them. Because anybody who thinks that we can or should control the anger and the fury and the message of street movements that erupt for justice is really fooling themselves about the conditions that exist and the power that we have as elected officials."
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"So let me ask you the obvious question. With half of the group leaning in the progressive direction and half in the moderate direction— and already so much sniping and fighting has come out. Obviously that’s not by design, necessarily. So how do you keep that majority together? How do you move forward? How do you make legislation when there is so much internal disagreement?"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,57,"They took on both the racial injustice part, but they also got sheriffs to endorse him, so it was clear where he stood on the issue. And he says, in the end, voters had that as maybe the third or fourth issue on their mind when they went to vote. He did lose his election. There was incredible turnout in that district. And so I just think we have to be very careful about how we analyze these results and what we assume to be in voters’ minds. I will tell you that I think the number one thing that is in voters’ minds is their lives and their livelihoods, something that I’ve seen a number of members of the Democratic Caucus say across the ideological spectrum. I am concerned about the fact that Donald Trump was a problem in and of himself, but he was also a symptom of a much bigger problem."
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"Let me ask you a little bit about progressive policies and progressive rhetoric. So you mentioned Florida. And that’s a very interesting test case because Florida in this election went to Trump, as you mentioned. Florida in 2018 went to DeSantis, and they also held their Senate seat. At the same time in 2018, they re-enfranchised disenfranchised felons, although, of course, the legislature messed around with that. And then this time around, as you mentioned, just now, and also in a recent tweet, they passed minimum wage with 60 percent. So on the one hand, we can say, yes, people support progressive policies. But why is there that gap? Why aren’t they trusting Democrats to do it? Why are 10 percent or 12 percent of people voting for an increased minimum wage but voting for Trump?"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"Just following up from there for a second, the areas where there could be some movement— you obviously came to politics through immigration originally. Do you think there’s any room there for bipartisanship? Infrastructure you mentioned earlier. What do you think is plausible?"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"And if you had to do some of them— as Senator Warren proposed in her recent op-ed— if you had to do some of that stuff by executive order, as a member of what is supposed to be the bleeding edge of government, the Article I house— but it hasn’t been that for generations— how do you feel about that, extralegislative versions of those same policies? Is it worth the constitutional risk to get those things done?"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,57,"Well, I do think that they can be done, and they can also be levers to give more power back to the people’s house and to Congress. So in other words, if Joe Biden were to say, here are my day one executive actions, canceling X percentage of student debt, doing a $15 minimum wage for federal contractors, and just go down the line, then what he can say is, these are the things I’m going to do unless Congress acts immediately. And that can push Congress to really make that— do that work and move it forward with the threat that if we don’t, then there are some things that are too important, meaning the lives and livelihoods of the American people, regardless of which party you ascribe to, that Joe Biden is going to get done for us as president. That will benefit all of us. So yes, I would, of course, love to be able to pass bills through the House, but we also need the bully pulpit and the push of a president who is bold coming out of the gate and willing to say, I’m going to stand up for the people. I’m not going to tolerate this kind of inequity, racism, lack of health care, all of these things."
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"And we’re back. While Biden’s lead is continuing to grow as votes are counted before the certification deadline of December 8th, President Trump is still ranting and raving inside the White House through the medium of social media. He is saying there is fraud. He’s saying that there is a machine that flipped votes from him to Biden. He is going on and on about this and not letting up. In order to talk about the way that these forms of social media have interpenetrated into our political life but also our social lives, we have asked our colleague Kara Swisher, the host of “Sway“, a twice-weekly podcast about power that the Opinion section also produces. And really, there’s no one I would rather talk to about this than her. Kara, hi. How are you?"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,58,"And therefore they’re not taking responsibility for any of those roles. And one thing Mark does is— he says things— when you hear him talk about the First Amendment, free speech, you just literally want to say, I wish you had finished college. It might have been helpful for you to understand these things. But one of the things he tends to say is, I don’t want to be an arbiter of truth. But he built a platform that requires an arbiter of truth. And therefore, OK, if you don’t want to be, who is going to be? Because there needs to be on some of these platforms, especially around things like Steve Bannon or behavior or falsehoods or misinformation and disinformation. And it’s not just political. It’s everything. It’s vaccines. It’s QAnon. It goes on and on and on."
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,58,"Well, you know, it’s not right-wing. It’s a really— people misrepresent Silicon Valley as being liberal. I would say it’s libertarian-lite, which means people who don’t understand liberta— you know, avail themselves to government help when they need it and then disdain it when they don’t. Like, it’s a weird—"
3,The 46th: Progressive Democrats’ Next Moves Under Biden,56,"So, Kara, you were talking about the “oops” factor, right? They always drop back to the idea of, like, oh, yeah, it’s the algorithm, right? The whole drive behind affinity. I’m going to get to the like person and the like thing. That’s the central node of most of these. It’s dangerous, on the one hand, because it can bring and has brought together all kinds of conspiracy theorists, most notably, obviously, with QAnon. But it also has the capacity to be quite something on the— as a force for good. I mean, obviously this is a very vexing problem, but how do you collect communities without creating too much space for the lunatic fringe?"
3,Is ‘American Carnage’ Campaign Gold?,59,"I’m Frank Bruni. And this is “The Argument.” [THEME MUSIC] Protests against police brutality have been reignited after the shooting of Jacob Blake. And the Trump campaign sees an opportunity. As counter-protests turn lethal and the president continues to stoke division, what’s the political fallout of violence in American cities? How did it become a cudgel against Joe Biden and the Democrats and not an indictment of the man actually in charge?"
3,When Science Is Partisan,59,"No, I’m actually trying not to have an argument — I’m trying not to have an argument about the kid. I’m trying to have an argument, or not even an argument, about the disparate reactions to what’s going on. So I started— we went down this Kyle Rittenhouse rabbit hole when I was asking why people on the right were celebrating him, were lionizing, were going well beyond justifying him, including the president, right? And earlier, you made a reference, Ross, to will Joe Biden condemn certain actions on the left? Well, he has now in Pittsburgh yesterday. We’re recording on Tuesday."
3,When Science Is Partisan,59,"In Pittsburgh on Monday, he said, these protests that get out of hand, the sooner — we have — what I’m focused on here is the real imbalance between what Joe Biden has said and will say and I think will continue to say and what Donald Trump won’t say and isn’t saying. And it’s not just Donald Trump. This has spread throughout the Republican Party. There was a fascinating interview on Sunday that Dana Bash of CNN did with Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, where she asked him if he would condemn the violence. And he kept dancing around the words because he was clearly so worried that if he seemed to be condemning Kyle Rittenhouse and people who’d run to those burning stores that you’re talking about, Ross, that he would somehow alienate his political constituency. I just think that’s weird, dangerous, and unhealthy."
3,When Science Is Partisan,59,"I will grant you, Ross, the riots have been horrible. And I think sometimes, there’s a big element of truth to what you’re saying. And part of the challenge right now for Joe Biden is, I think, a lot of people feel that they’re not hearing a stern enough condemnation, that people are not admitting fully that people gave protesters too much of a pass in terms of gathering amid a pandemic and all of that."
3,When Science Is Partisan,60,"And that means that our government was going to be overwhelmed, whatever happened here. The question is not, was our government ready? The question is, have we responded and mobilized since then in the way that we should have? The answer to that in a lot of ways at the federal level is no. And there’s no question that the president has had a lot to do with that. But we should also see that there are some impressive ways that the American federal government and certainly the states have responded impressively. And we’re getting our act together. You know, the public did react — I would say I’ve been surprised at the willingness of the American public to basically shut things down the way we have in the course of a couple of weeks. I think we’re now, in the course of the next few weeks, going to start gradually reopening things. And I would just say — I mean, maybe I’m overly influenced by my own experience working in the White House and working on some issues like this on a much smaller scale. I think pandemonium in response to a crisis this massive is unavoidable. The question is, how do you mobilize? And we are mobilizing, despite some enormous problems at the top."
3,When Science Is Partisan,60,"Well, look, I certainly wish he hadn’t done all those things and then some. But I think that the American biomedical enterprise, which is an academic and government and private sector enterprise, is rising to this challenge in some impressive ways. I think there needs to be more urgency on the part of the federal government — and that’s Congress and the president — in pushing for treatments for the worst cases here, because that’s the only real near-term way out. Vaccine will be great when it comes, but that’s a long way off. And I would say we haven’t seen the necessary urgency yet. Congress passed another bill just last week that patched some of the problems in the CARES Act and did not focus on treatment in the way they might have. Did not empower the NIH in the way they might have. In some ways we’re lucky here. I think the National Institutes of Health is an extraordinarily well-run institution in this moment."
3,When Science Is Partisan,60,"Tony Fauci has a real job, and it’s an important job right now. It’s one of the most important jobs in our government. And he has to spend an enormous amount of his time both preparing for and actually going through those bizarre public spectacles. Robert Redfield is at these press conferences a lot. He works in Atlanta. He runs the agency that is in charge of responding to this pandemic on behalf of our country. It is bizarre that they have to spend this much time basically soothing the president’s ego in public."
3,When Science Is Partisan,60,"No, that doesn’t make me uncomfortable. I think in this case, I would. There would have been a lot that I would disagree with a President Hillary Clinton about, and there’s some that I disagree with a President Donald Trump. I didn’t have anybody to vote for last time. It doesn’t seem like I will this time. And I certainly think there are a lot of ways in which almost anybody who could plausibly have been president would be doing a better job now. Because President Trump’s sense of what the presidency is is so performative, is so rooted in his own background as a kind of reality television figure. He’s the first of our presidents who has not been either a senior military officer or a high-ranking elected or other official in our government before becoming president. And, you know, we’ve been lucky that we haven’t had a crisis like this that has called on that level of experience in the past few years. But here we are. Now we do, and it shows that that experience is not there."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,61,"We had to rush to our microphones and record this special episode because of the really exciting events in the U.K. — the election, which has resulted in a hung parliament and has raised speculation that the DUP, the Northern Irish Party, may be called in to shore up a conservative government. So we’ve been flooded with questions because of the shock result about, you know, who are the DUP? So we decided to make this special episode which is about unionism."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,63,"I am the deputy editor of the Northern Ireland current affairs website, Slugger O’Toole. The DUP has traditionally been seen as one of Northern Ireland’s more traditionally conservative political parties. So, it is an unavowedly pro-union party. So it wants to keep Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Some English journalist friends who are DM’ing me on Twitter and ringing me and asking me similar sorts of questions. So who is Nigel Dodds? And what’s he like? And what did the DUP stand on this? And why won’t Sinn Féin take their seats in the House of Commons? You have to remember the Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party, the Conservatives don’t seriously contest in Northern Ireland. We kind of have our own political system with our own main parties who contest locally. They don’t contest across the rest of the U.K. So it has always been seen as a place apart."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,62,"Yeah. And for our listeners around the world or for people who may have been hiding under a rock somewhere, the U.K. just voted in what they call a hung parliament. And if you’re wondering what this says in a nutshell, it means that no one party has won enough seats to secure an overall majority in the Westminster government."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,61,"It’s a massive shock for the U.K. Conservative Party and for their leader, Theresa May. So essentially she didn’t have to call this election. She chose to. She called a snap election in a gamble, in the hopes of increasing her majority even further than she had to give her a mandate to negotiate Brexit. But now, you know, her political future is completely in question."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,62,"It’s a massive shock for the U.K. Conservative Party and for their leader, Theresa May. So essentially she didn’t have to call this election. She chose to. She called a snap election in a gamble, in the hopes of increasing her majority even further than she had to give her a mandate to negotiate Brexit. But now, you know, her political future is completely in question."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,61,"Right. So you might be asking at this point, “Aren’t I listening to the Irish passport?” Like, where does Ireland come into this whole story? Well, a lot of publishers may be trying to play it down, but Ireland will be at the very center of any Brexit scenario."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,62,"Yeah, all of this is kind of silently revolving around the infamous border question. The border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, which is an independent state, is set to become the only land border between the U.K. and the European Union once Britain leaves the EU."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,62,"If you want to learn more about the border, where it came from, and how people living there have reacted to these recent developments, we urge you to go back and actually listen to our last episode, our pilot episode of the Irish Passport, which is totally dedicated to the border. But for now, we’re going to focus on this hung parliament on its significance in relation to the border."
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,61,"Okay. So the DUP are a unionist Party. They’re the biggest unionist party in Northern Ireland. So that basically means they’re pro-British in their outlook generally and they’re committed to keeping Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. That puts them at odds with the other major party in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin, who want the opposite. They want Northern Ireland to be part of one united Ireland. The origins of the DUP are that it was founded by the late Reverend Ian Paisley. His son is still in politics. There’s another Ian Paisley knocking around these days, but his father was a, you know, a religious radical, and the party to this day is still quite closely linked to a number of Protestant churches and particularly the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, which was founded by Paisley himself"
4,UNIONISM ELECTION SPECIAL,62,"Being a unionist Party, the DUP have traditionally been quite hostile to cooperation with the neighboring Irish Republic. The party has drawn many of its members, actually from the former Ulster Resistance paramilitary group. The Ulster Resistance Group collaborated, to give you an idea, during the conflict with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the UDA, another extremist group, which were the main pro-British terrorist groups active during the conflict. So there’s not a little touch of irony here, considering that conservatives accused Jeremy Corbyn of collaborating with Republican extremists during the campaign. The DUP, incidentally, also opposed the Good Friday Agreement, originally in 1998, and that agreement brought about the cross-community Northern Ireland Assembly. However, in the last few years, they have softened their stance a little bit."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,61,"Yes, we are, of course, talking about Brexit, the UK leaving the EU, which is an incredibly complicated process which has implications for everything from nuclear energy to whether planes can take off the ground. And it also had massive implications for Ireland, not least because of that complex, uncontested border that cuts across the island of Ireland, as we discussed in our first episode."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,64,"The reaction that I saw in the EU, a certain amount of reaction to a democratic process of Brexit, I felt they were very kind of pompous about it all. A large amount of them are actually unelected yet seemed to wheel a lot of power and I kind of like that Brexit, it was kind of cutting off your nose to spite your face, maybe, but it also took back a little bit of power for what I think could eventually get out of control with the EU."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,64,"Probably more negatives than positives. I think England, Britain, can handle a better because they got a bigger economy whereas I think we would kind of suffer a bit more from it, I think. And I think, around college here, if that would affect the travel of like students from all Europe to come here, that would be a negative."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,64,"Well, I welcome the project that you’re working on because we don’t discuss it enough, we should. I don’t take a simplistic view of the Brexit, the British Brexit thing, that it’s necessarily the evil that it’s been described as. Don’t know, and we won’t know until time will tell, you know. I was living in England when the currency issue was being debated. It was crazy. And we were laughing at them. I went to the U.K. and they had a different perspective. And that was when I really began to think that we should think critically. Not necessarily criticize and bitch about Europe or bitch about Britain either. Don’t take a side, be objective and sit down and work out all of the pros and cons before we actually make decisions instead of shooting from the hip, which is what the politicians do. We gonna have to educate ourselves about what legislation means and can we be manipulated? Can our futures be manipulated by legislation?"
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,64,"Because we can be and we are. And we might be seeing whether Britain has made a good decision or a bad decision. I’m not going to judge them on that. One thing I do know, I’ve got, personally, I’ve got family who came from the north, and were run out of the north by the British, by the unionists who represented the British opinion over there. Nonetheless, I give the British full credit for making the right decision on the euro, and I’m not prepared to rush to judgment and say that they’ve made a wrong decision on Brexit until we can see how it goes. As a person who wanted a united Ireland, I think strategically Brexit offers opportunities to us. If we could play our cards right and negotiate cleverly on behalf of the people of the north at the moment."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,61,"A united Ireland. It’s a phrase that people in Ireland just can’t seem to help bringing up when it comes to discussing Brexit. Google searches for the term united Ireland spiked more than 600 percent the day after the Brexit vote. It even featured recently on the front page of the Financial Times. That was back in April and it was because the Irish government had just secured what it saw as an early victory in the Brexit process. Basically, it managed to get the leaders of all the remaining EU governments to agree that if Northern Ireland ever democratically chose to join with the republic into one country, then it would automatically be part of the EU without any need for any sort of entry process."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,61,"It would basically be just like what happened with the reunification of Germany, so that automatic entry was explicitly stated in notes to the EU’s Brexit negotiating guidelines in April. The 27 remaining EU countries voted unanimously to adopt those guidelines and the vote took less than one minute. I spoke to a man who was in the room. Ireland’s then minister for European Affairs, Dara Murphy. He was fresh out of negotiations and we met up to discuss Ireland and Europe. He told me that unexpectedly, Brexit was drawing Ireland and the rest of the EU closer together and improving the way that the EU works."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,65,"I’m chairman of the EPP Europe ministers, as well as being a vice president to the EPP and I’ve been at, must be hundreds of Brexit related meetings. And I have to say, I’ve been at, I don’t know, many, many hundreds of meetings since I’ve been at Europe minister for a few years, three years, I’ve never seen such unity of purpose between the member states, between the institutions and even between the political families as there is on the issue, on the issues, of Brexit. The key elements of the guidelines were agreed yesterday unanimously without dissenting voice from any member state. And I think that that is pretty unique in my time."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,65,"I’m not prepared to say , you know that is not a matter for us. That would be a matter in the first instance for the people of Northern Ireland to determine and to work with, you know, within their own communities and ultimately to have a referendum. Given the other challenges that Northern Ireland is currently facing as we all collectively face with respect to Brexit and by we all, I would include, of course, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, I think we need to focus at this time on ensuring that we minimize the damage for Ireland. All of Ireland, north and south and indeed Europe and the UK. As I say, my own strong view is this is not the time for foreign border poll. But that, of course, would be a matter for others to decide."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,65,"I’ve nothing really to add further other than to say that the template for how the European Union has approached this crisis, this difficult reality, this methodology, the Barnier methodology, so to speak, I think is something that A. we need to continue through this process but I have been struck by how effective it has been, so we have all the challenges and, you know, I think maybe in time I think you may well see this type of Barnier approach replicated."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,66,"Sometimes I come across, and people write that I’m sort of a mad Irexiter. I think it was a very sad day when Brexit occurred. I regret greatly that we’ve found ourselves in this position. But we’ve got to choose the least, worst way forward now and not let sentiment or kneejerk reaction get in our way. There’s arguable cases for both continuing with the remaining members of the European Union and also looking at the possibility of a new arrangement with the European Union because of our unique situation, particularly the border, what we need cannot be catered for in the normal EU-style arrangements. What I’m trying to do is maintain the present advantageous situation as near as possible. And it seems to me that it’s much easier to negotiate that outside the European Union rather than just stay in one of 27."
4,IRELAND AND EUROPE,66,"It’s not an easy thing to do to square this, and I think we should have said from day one that Brexit causes all sorts of problems, that we have to almost become another strand in negotiations. I do think the Irish government is serious enough now. I think they’re going down the wrong path. I think they’ve made a bad decision not to go for a unique settlement. The European Union is changing, and without the British as allies, I think there will be a further move towards a kind of a German-French axis and that’s something that we are very, very uncomfortable with as a lot of smaller countries are. There isn’t a huge identification with Europe, unlike a lot of other places. There isn’t the same attachment, as you would say, in Luxembourg and some other places. We should be discussing every possibility. And in the end maybe staying with the European Union might be the best thing."
4,The Brexit Irish,67,"Immediately after the referendum last year, we were inundated with requests for passport application forms. We had many, many tens of thousands of requests for forms, in some cases for multiple forms. And we had to send them out. We estimate we may have sent out a 100,000 passport forms in the space of, say, a few weeks after the referendum last year.And also all of the Irish centres in Britain, we had trouble keeping their centres stocked. Most days I would see a consignment of passport forms coming in from Dublin that I would see a large bag of mail going out with passport forms was being sent all over Britain. So that was a huge challenge."
4,The Brexit Irish,67,"Well, you can only draw one conclusion, because for the last few years, demand for Irish passports in Britain was pretty flat, which suggests the population had levelled out, and then last year, the first half of the year, the demand was more or less what it had been the previous year and then the second half of the year after the referendum, was shot up. So there’s only one answer to that question, which is that Brexit made a material difference. Now I suspect that people were motivated by two considerations."
4,The Brexit Irish,67,"The first being practical. One, the people who felt they might want to study or work or just, you know, move to other European countries and wanted to make sure that they wouldn’t be inconvenienced by Britain leaving the EU. And then the second group, probably a much smaller group but nonetheless less significant, will be people who simply wanted to make a statement that I’m European, that the way I can do that is by sort of taking an Irish passport and you know, demonstrating in that way a European identity."
4,The Brexit Irish,67,"Well, I mean, look, these are people who maybe in the past didn’t seek to have Irish passports and they seek to have them now. That suggests that they see their Irish identity as part of a wider European identity. So I’m not saying that they don’t value an Irish identity, and maybe many of these people may be people who had been thinking for some years perhaps about getting an Irish passport but never got around to it. You know, these are children, grandchildren of Irish citizens that say who may say, who may have said over the years, “yeah I’d like to get an Irish passport. It’d be great” and just never did it. And then were, when the, you know, the Brexit referendum occurred, they thought, “Oh, I’m going to do it now.” It wasn’t necessarily the only factor for people, but I think it was maybe the factor that explains why it happened last year."
4,The Brexit Irish,68,"I’m Daniel Gallagher from Scotland. I live near Glasgow, which everyone near Glasgow just calls Glasgow. I took up my Irish citizenship end of 2015 because my dad, as he’s Irish by birth and if you’re born to an Irish parent that makes you Irish. But he was born outside of Ireland, so that means that I’m not automatically Irish, but I can just claim citizenship so I can register as a foreign-born Irish. So I started looking into it from about 2013, but never put a huge amount of haste into it until this sort of referendum was announced. I thought that’s maybe the time to get it done just in case there’s a rush afterwards. It’s been a really interesting podcast all of this stuff is things that, like it wasn’t like I knew a little bit of some of this history, but I didn’t know any of this had happened, which made me feel kind of bad then, like yeah you’ve become a citizen and you know nothing about the country at all."
4,The Brexit Irish,68,"And I asked whether or not people in Ireland had, not so much of a negative view, I guess, but any view at all of the fact that tens of thousands of British people were now suddenly claiming Irish citizenship after the Brexit vote when they hadn’t done so before and whether or not that was viewed as sort of an opportunistic thing and whether or not Irish citizenship is sort of being seen as a commodity for people in the U.K., I didn’t what experience you have yourself in the UK or the media in the UK or if the red top tabloids are pretty rabid. And if there were 65,000 Irish people apply for British citizenship, it would be a horrendous sort of feeding frenzy of all these tabloids. I just was hoping it wasn’t sort of the same thing where people are being looked down on. Because I think diaspora, obviously it’s to try and sort of Irish family internationally, but I can’t imagine the UK ever doing the same thing."
4,The Brexit Irish,69,"My name’s Helen Finch. I’m from Dublin, but I’m living in Leeds in the UK now. I lecture in German at the University of Leeds. Although I am Irish, I was born in Ireland I lived there until I was about 30, I’ve always had a British passport. My parents are immigrants from Britain. They registered me with a British passport when I was a baby. And I’ve always had a British passport since then. I always felt a bit funny as a teenager queuing up outside the British embassy and getting this piece of paper with a royal coat of arms on it. But I would try and squash that unease by going, “Well, we’re all part of Europe now.” The old divisions between Ireland and Britain mean nothing because national identities are dissolving into this really fantastic, open European identity.” They’re all burgundy passports. They all entitle you to the same rights as a European citizen. But now that after Brexit, I’ve got a real sense of unease that’s rising with using my British passport. I want to keep my European freedom of travel."
4,The Brexit Irish,69,"I want to keep my freedom to travel to Ireland whenever I want to, to see my family. I have a daughter. I want to make sure that she’s Irish and that she’s European, and has the same freedoms and privileges as a European citizen as I’ve always had growing up. I see Ireland as being a somewhat Republican, meaning in the sense that Irish identity welcomes the equality of all citizens, that it’s a cosmopolitan kind of identity, that you can be Irish but still live in lots of places in the world, that you can be Irish and still come from somewhere else. I love the Irish language. I love Dublin where I grew up, that’s my home. So having an Irish passport expresses my destiny in the sense of my loyalty to the country that reared and educated me. Where most of my friends live, where my parents still live. And which has welcomed my parents as English people and never made them feel until now unwelcome. Britain seems like a scary, inward looking place which is excluding foreigners, which is turning its back on the European dream. So I feel now that I have to choose. At the moment I can still have dual identity and sort of dual citizenship, but if it ever comes to it and I have to give up one or the other, I’m going to keep my Irish passport."
4,The Brexit Irish,70,"I’m Neil Black. I’m a doctor in Derry in Northern Ireland. Derry is very close to the border, but a lot of my colleagues come back and forth across the border, perhaps live on one side and work on the other. Suddenly there was a psychological shock of a separation where lives had become so open and so free. I remember stopping at army checkpoints. That was right the way through Northern Ireland, but particularly at the border, there would be huge concrete bollards, army barracks and more checkpoints. For some people like us, we want to continue to be treated as European and not as separate. For me, Northern Ireland has been separate Separated from Ireland. Separated from the United Kingdom because of geography and because of a difference in outlook. Whenever Northern Ireland was separated off physically, yeah, we were cut off physically from the rest of Ireland and I don’t want that, seeing the separation from my family."
4,The Brexit Irish,71,"My name is Michael Armstrong. I’m originally from Carrickfergus, which is a town just north of Belfast. I played for an Irish passport, really, in a word, because of Brexit. I was posted in Brussels at the time of the referendum. Really, there’s a lot of kind of shock and sadness in the city at the time and it left a real impression on me. The other thing that did was that the lack of any real thought or debate about how Brexit would impact on Northern Ireland from UK politicians during the referendum and really in any real way since. So it was kind of a wakeup call, how little Northern Ireland kinda matters in the grand scheme of things and it was totally different. There’s a big contrast on the EU side because you had Michel Barnier’s team, they half like the Irish border as like one of their top three priorities. One of the things that I really took away from it was the extent to which continental Europeans kind of see the EU first and foremost as a peace project."
4,The Brexit Irish,71,"And after Brexit, there is a real focus on the Good Friday Agreement as part of that history. I felt part of that. I wanted to remain part of that, even if the UK was leaving the EU, I wasn’t going anywhere. Coming from Northern Ireland, you’re kind of a bit of mongrel as far as national identity is concerned. You kind of don’t fit in anywhere. There’s elements of Irish society that feels foreign to me. More foreign than stuff like the BBC or the NHS. I’m of the generation that grew up after The Troubles. The Good Friday kind of give you a freedom to develop and choose an identity or a mix of identities. Just, you know, get on with your life. I’m glad to have my Irish passport. It’s really nice, you know, coming through Dublin Airport to be told by you know the passport guys, “Welcome home.”"
4,Ireland’s abortion referendum: information warfare,72,"The core problem is that anybody can set up a Facebook page and anybody then can run ads against it and then build intelligence or a build audience understanding without anybody knowing who’s doing it or where the money is coming from. So arguably, this will be my personal view, this creates problems around how fair referendum campaign is running the country as open and small as Ireland. Because if anybody can come along from anywhere in the world and say, “O.K. We’re gonna run ads against these guys then we’re gonna share that data with one with an independent group or whether a private individual, then we’re going to keep saturating the Irish market with ads coming from outside, either on YouTube or Facebook or Twitter or Instagram, or wherever it is."
4,Ireland’s abortion referendum: information warfare,72,"What that allows you to do is get enormous amounts of content in front of Irish voters, where the voters don’t necessarily realize who is behind the ad, where the money came from or have any understanding of what’s going on. So in this example, the Undecided8 website was for all intents and purposes, was presenting itself as, “We are a neutral party. We’re gonna give you the facts about the referendum.” When in fact, that website was actually being run by a pro retain the Eighth Amendment group without ever saying that either on their Facebook page or on the website."
4,Ireland’s abortion referendum: information warfare,73,"I think we have a reach of about 50,000 at the moment. So yeah, we’re just trying to, we’re trying to reach as many people as we can and we have a lot of people that are following us. So I work with – I’m not on my own with Fact of the Day. So I have a few different people that are admins with me. So it’s not just myself, but like even even still, though, there’s other people that’ll send me messages. Just people. There’s a Facebook group about pro life that’s like a secret group. And there’s about a thousand people out there. And, you know, like a lot of people on their message, me or try to give me facts of the day they to put up. And yeah, it’s really, it’s really encouraging. And, you know, a lot of, a lot of reputable people, there’s lawyers in there, that are sending me stuff. There’s doctors. And all sorts of stuff."
4,Ireland’s abortion referendum: information warfare,73,"I know people in America that are very well-known and kind of like across the country. And they’re doing some great stuff too. Like they’re closing down, single-handedly I know a guy that’s closing down like all of the Planned Parenthood places in the entire state of Kentucky and stuff like that. I’m not working with them. But I know them. And we’ve learned a lot from them. Just about like just about like the facts regarding abortion and everything like that. Because they go out and they, you know, they try to help the women out. And they said they’ve actually saved hundreds of thousands of babies lives and they’re alive today because of it."
4,Ireland’s abortion referendum: information warfare,74,"I think a lot of misinformation out there. I think if you speak to, and I do regularly, to doctors involved in both the GP service and indeed our maternity services to what our hospital network, you speak to them individually, they will tell you. And many of them have spoken publicly on this over the last number of months, that Ireland is an exceptionally safe place to be a pregnant woman. We offer an extraordinary professional and quality service. And nobody, to my knowledge, in Ireland has suffered to the extent where they feel that their life or indeed the life of their child was anyway threatened by being part of or partaking in the Irish maternity services."
4,Ireland’s abortion referendum: information warfare,74,"And again, statistics and, you know, indisputable statistics internationally would show that Ireland is one of those safest places in the world to be a pregnant mother. And, you know, and if we are to argue about, “Can we improve those services?” Yes, of course we can. And I think the discussion around this whole debate has to move to a point where we have to be as supportive as you possibly can be of our pregnant women, are pregnant mothers, expectant mothers, and invest in the resources that can build that confidence. So that woman doesn’t have that perception, that she can feel absolutely safe in being a mother in Ireland in the 21st century."
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,75,"And as did many of the unions and many workers, in fact, tens of thousands of Irishmen from the working classes flooded into the Free State Army. And then when you go to the anti-treaty side, it often, it seems that there were a lot of poor rural populations that were fairly aloof from the anti-treaty struggle. And of course, there were also some of the celebrities of the revolution who came from the Anglo-Irish Protestant aristocratic community, people like Constance Markievicz and Erskine Childers, were very staunchly anti-treaty as well."
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,76,"Well, I think the republican position was simply “it’s all or nothing.” That if we don’t get what we want, we’ll fight on and we’ll achieve an end to partition, eventually. The logic of that position would be that a rejection of the treaty would mean continued conflict with the British army and ultimately conflict with the Ulster unionists. The opposite view was that there was going to be a boundary commission set up basically to adjudicate and draw the border between the new Irish free state and the existing entity called Northern Ireland. And the pro treatyites, believed that in the negotiations over the boundary commission, basically the British could be persuaded to reduce the size of Northern Ireland to perhaps four counties, in which case partition would be unviable."
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,76,"That didn’t happen, but I think the acceptance of partition by the free state for the time being was very much bound up with their view that violence cannot bring anything more than we’ve already achieved and that ultimately you have to reach out to the unionists. So, there was a kind of implicit split over the question of partition, even though it wasn’t the main issue in the civil war. The main issue in the civil war was the status of the free state and whether it was a republic or not."
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,76,A lot of the recent research has shown pretty clearly that many of the people who died in the civil war were assassinated or executed. It wasn’t a conventional war where people were fighting according to the laws of war. And I think the consequence was that it just produced this poisonous atmosphere.
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,75,"The role of gender in the conflict is really interesting and where arguably there is a deeper strain of kind of a radicalism. And so, for example, famously in the Dáil Éireann, that voted and debated on the treaty in December 1921 and January 1922, all of the female TDs, and I believe there were seven of them, voted against the treaty. The political status of women in Ireland, of course, suffered in the 1920s and 30s and there was a kind of a slow-moving kind of disenfranchisement from the public sphere or the political sphere. So, in many ways, the women who took part in the revolution are often seen as one of the losers of the revolution as a result."
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,75,"Instead of a very left, right, centre kind of party divide, you’ve got a pro-treaty side and an anti-treaty enshrined in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil tradition’s respectively. One view, one way of looking at it is while it might be unusual by European standards to not have a very powerful Labour Party or a Communist Party sitting in Parliament or left right and all the different kind of groups you get under many parliamentary systems in 20th century Europe, that the Irish situation is a little bit more reminiscent of sort of a post-colonial country where the main parties that emerge are defined by their relationship to the old colonial power. And in this picture, the Fine Gael or pro-treaty is seen as having a slightly more flexible, receptive attitude towards Britain. The anti-treaty or Fianna Fáil tradition is seen as having a more militant kind of attitude against them."
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,76,"I think that’s still going on simply because the partition issue on the Northern Ireland conflict has slowed down the process of coming to terms with the civil war. All of these things would be much easier to deal with if they were past tense but they’re not past tense, they’re actually present tense. so, in that sense, you know, T.S. Eliot, the poet, you know, has this quote, “I question whether any genuine civil war really ends.”"
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,77,"So what I did was I sent out a copy of The Wind That Shakes the Barley, which had just won the Palme d’Or to the Fianna Fáil county and city councillors who were voters in the Irish Senate election, and just before Christmas, with a copy of the last ever my cousin wrote before his execution during the Irish Civil War in 1923. Because most of the voters would have been like in their 50s, 60s, they hadn’t been to the cinema, but all of them would have had a connection to the war of independence, a civil war, to family, uncles, grand-uncles, fathers, grandfathers, mothers and grandmothers in Cumann na mBan. And they got it. So when I went to the doors, I rang them up saying I’d like to meet with you to sit down — it’s like a job interview with 500 people –they all said, “Oh, you’re the guy who sent The Wind That Shakes the Barley.” By the time I finished the election process, it was the equivalent of driving from Kenmare, County Kerry where I’m from to Perth in Australia. 15,000 miles is what I drove around the country to visit all these people, and I beat three sitting Fianna Fáil senators on the first count and won a seat. And Brian Crowley said to me, “I didn’t think you could do it.”"
4,Irish politics and the Civil War,77,"Oh, yeah. I mean, it’s in the flag. In Ireland, in the Republic now, depending who’s took the numbers, 1 in 8 people are from somewhere else, were born somewhere else. Nobody would ever question someone being Polish and Irish or just Polish if they want, and nobody questions someone being Romanian and Irish or if you want to live in Ireland and be English, that’s fine. If you want to be English and Irish or Anglo-Irish, that’s fine too. If you’re in Northern Ireland and you want to be British, it can be that. Or you can be British and Irish, you can be both. We have no problem having Irish Americans or the Irish in Australia. The Irish in Argentina or New Zealand or wherever. We can accommodate all of that Irishness in its broadest sense well then surely, we can also accommodate those who live in Northern Ireland, who see themselves as British."
4,NATIONALISM,78,"The politics of our household was always progressive, and was always about Irish unity. We are nationalists in the Irish sense, not in the European sort of xenophobic exclusive sense. Irish nationalism, you know this, Naomi, looks more like South American nationalism. It’s more about freedom and sovereignty. It’s not about exclusionary or supremacist politics."
4,NATIONALISM,79,"So in that sense, you’ve got greater interaction between Irish people and English people, than you would have between Indian people and England or certain African countries and England. There were things in the Irish story that I think are particularly important. And one of them is, actually, the tendency of so many Irish people historically, sometimes in tragic circumstances, to go abroad. And therefore, that Irish nationalism and Irish identity is something which people listening in the United States or Canada or England, Scotland, Wales or Australia or New Zealand will feel. And in that sense, Irish nationalism, Irish experience is a global thing, as well as being about the island that I’m speaking from, Ireland itself."
4,NATIONALISM,79,"I think one of the key things in Northern Ireland has been that the word nationalist has tended to be seen as something involved with the Irish nationalist community that feel that British sovereignty is perhaps illegitimate and certainly problematic. Whereas you could say that those who identify themselves as unionists in Northern Ireland are themselves nationalist. It’s just that they’re British nationalists. So words I would interpret that Northern Ireland’s political conflict as something between rival nationalisms, one Irish and one British. But the term nationalism has tended to adhere to the people from the Irish nationalist tradition rather than the British national tradition. There’s also the complication that, of course, while people are Irish nationalists in Belfast, and in Dublin, and in Galway, it’s been since the partition of Ireland in the 1920s a very different kind of national experience because those nationalists who are Irish nationalists in the north have felt themselves living in a state where they weren’t the majority of where the symbols of the state until very recently were somewhat hostile to them."
4,NATIONALISM,80,"I think by the end of the 19th century, what it meant to be a European nation was really bound up with the right to be a kind of an imperial power, in some ways. And the fact that Ireland was not just not an imperial power, but actually seemed kind of like a colony, made a lot of Irish nationalists really worried and really anxious. And in response to that, they started, I think, to project a much stronger image of what Irish people were like. That would, they hoped, refute the idea that Irish men, particularly, were really weak. So they started to project an image of of masculine power and masculine strength through things like language and sport."
4,NATIONALISM,80,"It’s really prevalent in British magazines like Punch in the middle of the 19th century and maybe even up until the 1880s. And then it’s gone. And then in a sense, Irish people get kind of replaced in British racism essentially by sub-Saharan Africans or by Indians. In all of these cases, I think what’s happening is that Britishness is being defined in opposition to things like Irishness or Blackness. And in a sense, what’s also being done is not just a kind of racial representation, but always a gendered representation. Images of what it means to be a British man and a kind of upstanding, strong British man are always constructed in opposition to these images of of Irish deformity or African or Indian deformity. If we look at a lot of those kinds of cartoons, then you can go on Google and find hundreds and hundreds of them of the Irish or of Africans or of South Asians. There’s almost always a British person in the caricature also. And I think that’s quite important to look at how they’re kind of dual representations of both British men and Irish men or whoever the person happens to be that they’re kind of denigrating."
4,NATIONALISM,80,"At the start of the 1890s, you get, in some ways, a kind of a retreat from what looks like formal politics. So, a lot of Irish nationals get turned off by electoral politics and they turn to things like the Gaelic League. So the Gaelic League is an organization that wants to promote the use of the Irish language. And I think they’re really interested, particularly in the idea that they can travel back in time, but also travel forward in time, which sounds kind of obscure. But what I think they’re trying to do is by learning — or, they would say relearning — the Irish language, that they’re in a sense reconnecting to an Ireland that existed prior to English rule over Ireland. And that image of a kind of very romanticized Irish past becomes also their image of what Ireland will be like in the future. That it’s an Ireland that is not ruled by England. And there’s something really strategic about this, that I think lots of national movements — or, particularly, colonial national movements — do of saying, “You’re right, we are a deformed people. But we’re deformed because you rule over us. If we were a sovereign, independent nation, we wouldn’t be like this.”"
4,NATIONALISM,80,"It’s a kind of it’s almost a kind of self-hatred that they say. Yet these stereotypes are real. We are really weak. Patrick Pearse, who’s very, very heavily involved in the Gaelic League, He wrote a pamphlet in 1913 or so called The Murder Machine about the English education system in Ireland, where he says the Irish are a nation of castrated men. Really, really graphic language that he uses about deformity. Like, we are a deformed nation. But there are ways to end that deformity. And the way and that deformity is by learning the Irish language, reconnecting with Irish culture. But a specific kind of Irish culture that is in no way Anglicized. There are a whole load of debates within Irish language circles at the start of the 20th century about which is the proper dialect of Irish. So there are three dialects within the Irish language. An Ulster, a Munster and a Connacht dialect. And really what that debate becomes is, is which is the most pure form of the language? This is one of the places where I think there’s a kind of an undercurrent of racial ideology here. Because really, what they’re saying is who is the most pure Irish person? So this is not really a debate about language. It’s debate about race."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,81,"There was a fascinating piece by one of the country’s leading opinion pollsters, and the long term commentator, Peter Kellner, which suggested there were seven different versions of a referendum question, some of them two stages, over two or three weeks. I thought that just underlines the challenges of all this. Of course, you’ve highlighted the fact that there is not a lot of time. There is speculation that we could of course ask for extra time under the Article 50 arrangements, which are giving us this two year negotiation, which runs out on the 29th of March. Yes, we could ask and the rules are pretty well known, but we have to ask from the UK, and the EU have to agree unanimously."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,81,"There was the court case recently that established that we could actually also withdraw Article 50. I am still waiting to see who the leader of a political party is, or,Prime Minister that would actually trigger these events, I don’t think we’ve got to the points, but certainly if a general election was coming or we got credibility around a second referendum, you would need Article 50 to be extended, there just isn’t the time is there."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,82,"That’s exactly right, and some people have suggested that, a myth that seems to be doing the round, is that the court judgment around revoking Article 50 was part of the negotiations itself. Do you just want to debunk that, because it was someone from your neck of the woods that initiated this, rather than someone around the EU – UK negotiating table."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,81,"There was a cross party and cross parliamentary group of individuals, who took this case to the European Court of Justice, just to establish whether it was right and fair from the way it was written that you could actually withdraw unilaterally, because you can extend, that’s clear and there is a process, but it wasn’t so obvious what to do about withdrawing it."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,82,"They all become a bit circular, don’t they? But one of the important things that you said there, which again I think is relevant to a number of them, is the difference between what parliamentarians and political campaigners might want, versus what the Government wants, and what they might chose to do, and ultimately they do hold the levers of control in determining whether or not we would extend, revoke, or have another election, etc."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,81,"And talk of parliament getting the opportunity to consider all these different new options or refreshed options has obviously gained ground in recent weeks, and it is good to have the debate, but there’s a big difference between Parliament stopping the executive, the Government doing something, and actually taking over and running with the ball."
5,A political update with 100 days to go,82,"That’s right. So, what Norway might mean, or at least what people are suggesting, we should do with Norway, is that at the end of the Article 50 process, we should park ourselves in the EEA EFTA type arrangement, so we would be trading on similar rules to Norway. So, quite closely aligned with the single markets, minimum friction issues, and this seems to have been gaining ground with people around Michael Gove, around the DEFRA Secretary, Nick Boles, being a particular advocate for this. However, the challenge is that Norway as the existing big member of the EEA doesn’t like it. In fact, talking to some people around the Norwegian politics, they would be more than happy to see the UK potentially in a longer-term arrangement, but they certainly don’t see themselves as a temporary car park."
5,What's already changed for good?,83,"January seems like a very long time ago and indeed so much has happened since then. I think the best way of thinking about how Brexit has affected the UK economy so far this year is that we actually had a relatively good first quarter for the economy. Household spending held up as it has done ever since the referendum, people are continuing to spend money, probably in the absence of really knowing what else there is to do. But what we saw is that business investment, which has been where Brexit has really hit the economy so far, actually did quite well, for the first time in a year or so, but the reasons for that aren’t necessarily all that great. Businesses saw this March 29th deadline for Brexit and then stepped up their no deal planning as we saw in a good quarter for the manufacturing industry, and a lot of imports as well. Those two things together meant that businesses spent a lot of money preparing themselves for what they would do if there was a sudden no deal Brexit on March 29th."
5,What's already changed for good?,83,"Yeah exactly, and the stock piling component was unusually large for this quarter as well. So, that combined meant we got a good first quarter, but the trouble is that’s not sustainable, because they did this preparation, in the end they didn’t really need them, because now we have the extension. Now we are expecting to see business investment continuing to fall again, resuming its previous trend for the second and third quarters and onwards until we get some more clarity."
5,What's already changed for good?,84,"One of the things I took away from our conversation in January, you’ve reminded me of again there, is the fact that Brexit isn’t the only show in town in terms of economic projections, and remembering that there are bigger trends around the world that also have real implications for us here in the UK."
5,What's already changed for good?,84,"We did, I mean I can’t remember those times! I want to get back to the point you made around preparations in the run up to March, because we’ve been thinking about it, within the beyond Brexit team, how we move away from looking at Brexit as a one off point in time phenomenon to the prevailing backdrop. We’ve been using the phrase ‘Brexit as usual,’ because this uncertainty that businesses are operating within at the moment, isn’t even going to end if we get a deal or no deal, kind of, resolution on which scenario is in play. There is then a prolonged period of uncertainty as that scenario plays out."
5,What's already changed for good?,83,"I think this is a really valid point, because all the agreement gets us to, is the next stage in the negotiation towards a free-trade agreement. This isn’t the end of Brexit, it's going to be a multiyear process at best, and could end up being a much longer one. So the key question for us, when we look at particularly business investment, which is the area where we have seen the strongest impact from Brexit, is to what extent is the investment that hasn’t taken place over the last year or so, to what extent has that been deferred or cancelled altogether."
5,What's already changed for good?,85,"Well Emily, I think for businesses, what has really changed is the type of uncertainty that they are facing. In the first few quarters after the referendum, uncertainty levels were running high, but they were centred around the nature of the deal that the UK would strike with the EU, and the classic question back then was, is it going to be a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit. But now we are three years down the line since the referendum, uncertainty levels still remain high, but it’s the type of uncertainty that’s changed, particularly in the last 6 to 12 months."
5,What's already changed for good?,84,"I absolutely recognise what you were just saying there. There is one other uncertainty I would add to your list, actually, that I am picking up on, is the timing of it all. Those are all big questions, but we also don’t know when any of those different states will come into effect. I am not sure many of us were expecting the flextension when we were modelling scenarios even a year ago, and certainly there is a big question over whether or not there will be a further extension in October, I know is troubling many of the clients that I speak to."
5,What's already changed for good?,85,"I think manufacturing, if you just focus on that for a second, it has done relatively well, and that’s driven by the fact that we export quite a lot of our manufactured goods and the cheapest earning has helped. That affect is dissipating now, and if you look at some of the forward looking surveys for the sector, they are looking more gloomy than in the past."
5,What's already changed for good?,85,"The first victim of Brexit has been business investment in the UK, and the typical comparisons we economist carry out is, we compare business investment levels in the UK against its major competitors, the G-7 economies. If you look at how that’s been evolving ever since the referendum, so on average all of the G-7 economies, excluding the UK, they have been growing their business investment levels all the time, whereas in the UK, it sort of stayed relatively stable, and now for the past four quarters it’s on a slight decrease. You can clearly see the effect of uncertainty on business investment, but the interesting thing is actually, when you zoom in to the business investment levels, and see how that composition of business investment has changed."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,87,"Well, I suppose, it’s a difficult one, it’s not an easy answer to a very difficult question. What we are trying to seek planning around, and help around is proper working capital thoughts. Actually, you know under new levels of debtor creditor days, inventory cycles, how does your business look, where are the hard times going to be, so that you can really get a good handle on that and be really upfront, either with your financers, your bankers, how is it going to work in your business, in what we hope would be a period of disruption that gets back to normal. So, therefore, hopefully nothing that can’t be coped with over a period of time, but a period of time, different to what management teams usually cope with."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,88,"Having said all that, there are some common themes and some of them we share with the other industries, frictionless borders, if we get fresh food stuck coming through, that is an issue. People, we actually employ a lot of people from the EU in the industry. Also, things like foreign exchange and volatility, and all that impact on confidence and consumer spending, so they do share all of those concerns."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,87,"And I’ve heard that in manufacturing as well. People really understand, they know, to try and the employee strategy of trying to help people feel secure, and work with them on their declarations, pay for that and for their family. So, actually trying to see how that works through is very important for our sector as well."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,86,"The pharma and life science sector in terms of the direct employees, obviously employs actually quite a high percentage of EU, staff from EU, non-UK EU countries. We’ve seen from the Migration Advisory Committee just before Christmas that there is a view that residents and travel to the UK should be facilitated for those earning higher salary, higher qualification level."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,86,"Existentially there is less of a threat for a lot of those types of roles in pharma, but that doesn’t stop the more subjective feeling of people, thinking is it as attractive to work in the UK as elsewhere."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,86,"There is definitely communication to be done and engagement with staff within pharma and life science companies on that basis. Also, you mustn’t forget that the second tier supply level. There are, for instance, logistics providers for whom operational issues could be very dramatic for pharma companies. If pharma companies’ suppliers are suffering that is still an issue that needs to be addressed, and that’s where some of the lower skilled and lower salaried workers are involved."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,87,"Yeah certainly some conversations I have had with clients even over the last week is around, and actually very different in different companies, different regions. So I don’t think, there is a brush that goes across this, but certainly the level of recruitment, particularly on that agency workers, and actually they were saying that they had much shorter lists when they’ve been going out looking for people than they had in the past."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,87,"They were putting that down to Brexit, I don’t know, but actually it was interesting to hear that directly from clients in the manufacturing space, particularly potentially at that lower factory operator level. It’s something that people are on a watch on, because skills has been a key area that we’ve talked about for years, and therefore that’s a deep concern."
5,How are different industries preparing for Brexit?,88,"I think it shows a little bit how the consumer is feeling, that we’re now getting talk about consumer stockpiling, and this is at a time of squeezed consumer income. So, this whole stockpiling could actually make the problem worse. We have been saying to our clients that they probably should think about one to two weeks of extra stock than they normally have, and think about the working capital implications of that. But actually, what they actual consumer does, could actually make the whole thing a little bit worse than that."
5,Is the deal done?,89,"Well, I think we need to be cautious. So, having the political agreement is certainly a positive step forward, but it is still going to go through a legal ratification process, and as Anna suggested, time is tight. We’ve really got to be mindful of the fact that in the remaining time, the firms still need to think about what their continuity plans are in the event of a no deal, and in selective cases, perhaps move forward with some of those plans."
5,Is the deal done?,89,"As we talked about before, and we had a recent blog by Katy Wallace, who advised of six areas of continuity planning. These will vary from organisation to organisation, but all businesses should look to those areas which are most relevant, and also those areas, which may take time to address. Things like increasing stock levels, making sure you know your suppliers (end-to-end supply chain) and their Brexit exposures, continue to look at issues around personal data, and where it’s held, make sure you’ve got the right approvals or licences to be able to continue trading, look at HMRC accreditations now; and also look at your systems, both for supply chain, but also your workforce."
5,Is the deal done?,90,"In this case, and many others companies should be assessing their exposure now and knowing what they need to do, but holding off taking action while they can. In terms of the future deal, at the moment, when recording this podcast, we only have seven pages, although we are told that there will be more details soon. It is all pretty high level stuff, but we can already see that this is shaping up to be, what I would describe any way, as a fairly standard or be it nonetheless ambitious free trade agreement or services, with some form of customs union along with single market rules for goods."
5,Is the deal done?,90,"Well, that’s why I was careful to say “some form of customs union”, because logically that’s where this is heading. This would retain frictionless borders for goods trade, but at the expense of striking new trade deals, sovereignty, and long-term competitiveness. For these reasons, because the detail simply isn’t yet ready, the future declaration may be slightly fuzzy on this as well as other issues. Let’s not forget this is a political declaration, so it is not actually legally binding. To some extent, it will change as negotiations and importantly politics evolve."
5,Is the deal done?,89,"Well it is absolutely right to be focussing on the contingency planning side of things, but there are a number of no regret actions that will bring benefits in all circumstances, and should be taken forward now. Indeed, many of those covered in our contingency planning blog that Andrew referred to earlier, such as knowing your supply chain, reviewing contracts, engaging your employees, these are “no regret” activities."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,91,"Yes of course, it’s the next step in European and UK data protection law. So, we’ve had data protection law in Europe since 1968, in fact, that was when the first law was passed. What the law does is, gives consumers more rights over their data, and it gives them more power to enforce a law. So, for instance, they’ll have a right of data portability and a right to pursue compensation claims if they want to."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,91,"It also gives the statutory regulators, in this case, the Information Commissioner, more enforcement power, so they can take audit steps if they want to, and intervene in business."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,92,"Yeah, I think, it’s really interesting, you know, this is quite a complicated set of rules, and what we are seeing is, sort of, very different approaches. At one end, you’ve got some organisations, who are really focused on this, that are spending the right time with the right level of programmes; really thinking about, right, what outcomes do we need to achieve, and already, you know, you are beginning to feel that in the, sort of, the contracting in the corporate world today."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,92,"You’ve got other organisations that perhaps are focused on this, but thinking about it more of as a tick box sort of exercise, and they may be patting themselves on the back saying, ‘you know, we are doing okay’. But I think they have to be very cautious that this is not about tick box, this is really about rights, it’s about the availability of data, it’s about obligations for companies around data, and they could come a little bit unstuck."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,92,"Now lastly, you’ve got a category of organisations, as we’ve heard, you know, this impacts everybody, where perhaps they’ve not started. They have not really thought about it. They have not thought about their business processes and how that’s going to be changed. So, it’s not too late for them, because clearly, although it’s getting implemented in May, there is still time, and there is time beyond May, still to put in place the right protocols to comply, as we’ve heard."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,91,"Well, when Brexit happened, the General Data Protection Regulation will not exist in our law automatically. So, in order to deal with that, Parliament is moving the Data Protection Bill through those parliamentary processes. That is due to be receiving royal assent this year. So, we will have our own national legislation that replicates the GDPR; and in fact takes it much further than the GDPR actually goes. For example, it takes the GDPR into the intelligence services, which is missed by the European scheme, and it takes it into parts of the public sector that are missed by the European scheme. So, the UK will have effectively ‘GDPR plus’ after Brexit. So, in that sense, we can be confident that our preparations that Kevin mentioned are to good value and to gain."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,91,"It is, I mean, for people who are hoping that we don’t have a data protection law because of Brexit. I think it’s important to understand that it was the UK that proposed the GDPR in the first place, it wasn’t France, Germany, Spain, Italy; it was us. So, we are getting a law that is built in our own image in light of the perils that the UK economy is understood. For instance, security breaches being a big concern, Kevin."
5,What does Brexit mean for GDPR?,91,"The European scheme allows data to flow freely within the European Economic Area. When we leave, we are outside of the area, so we will not be able to flow personal data from Europe into the UK without a mechanism to do so. Presently there is a power for Europe to confer an adequacy badge or decision on another country. So, Europe could say, ‘yeah the UK is great, it’s got good law, good regulatory practice, a good judicial system, and therefore the UK is adequate, and there will be no barriers to receiving data from Europe’. If that doesn’t happen, there are mechanisms built into the legislation for businesses, and private sector, and public sector entities to use. For instance, you can put in place contracts to allow data to flow from Europe into the UK."
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,93,"So I think that, at the heart of it was, a ‘how does the sector respond to the challenges that it sees around it’, not just Brexit, although Brexit is front of mind for many people, but the emerging digitisation of financial services, the growing threat from offshore financial centres in Singapore, Hong Kong and new financial service centres we don’t know about it yet in Africa or the Middle East. But also what was, I think, driving it very strongly was the sense that the sector had lost the trust of people - and the work that PwC did with the citizens jury brought that home - and that to recreate itself, to transform itself, the sector needed to rebuild those gloves of trust and to demonstrate it was there to serve its customers, whether that’s you and me going into our local high street branch, bank branch or insurer, or whether it is great multinational seeking to trade across world. So trying to recreate that sense of trust and that sense of identity, why is the sector here, what it’s for and where, and whose purpose it’s there to serve was really important in driving the report."
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,94,"Yes, that’s really interesting. But I could say that surely you were always focusing, the industry was always focusing on its customers. So what did the report say that the industry actually had to do to change, in order to become more trustworthy, if you like?"
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,93,"I think we should just emphasize the point that this was something that came not just from customers, but from bank CEOs and chairs that PwC interviewed. So it wasn’t seen as being imposed upon the sector from outside, the sector saw it was fairly in itself and wanted to correct. I think that’s really important, because I think that recognition that they want to change actually is really important. Because if they don’t want to change, then nothing will happen – so, the leadership is right behind us."
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,93,"So there are a couple of things I would say. First of all, businesses need to be ready for Brexit. People can’t put off their plans for relocation services whether that’s important to serving their customers in the future. But I think that Brexit is only one challenge and I was talking to the CEO of a bank who said to me, you know, it’s really important, Brexit, but the two things that keep me awake at night are digital and Chinese banks. And I just thought that struck me as a very powerful insight, that yes, you must prepare for Brexit, but you must prepare for future as well - prepare for those of emerging challenges."
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,94,"So, you’ve talked there about, you know, a kind of very confident, flexible way of dealing with the international challenge. What I thought was really interesting about the report was the way it talked about financial services throughout the UK and actually, almost if we did nothing, that’s likely to change quite significantly. Did I read that correctly?"
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,93,"You did and there are 2.2 million people working in financial and related professional services, two-thirds of whom are outside the M25, but when you look at where the value is created, it is predominantly in London. Now, one of the big strengths of this report is a clear vision for how we ensure that centres outside London grow and how they can generate more value. So it’s not just a back office function that’s happening in Birmingham or Bournemouth or Belfast or Glasgow, it’s front office, it’s middle office, it’s the professional services, it’s the lawyers, the accountants, who support and sustain these operations - and I think that’s one of the transformative things about this: you can’t just assume it will be London in the future that will provide the core of the UK as a global financial centre, it has to happen at a regional level as well."
5,Financial Services in a post-Brexit world,94,"Yeah that’s really interesting, I thought it was really interesting that the growth rates outside London were really quite dramatic, so if you think the impact that will make on Manchester or wherever that’s really important. So, another kind of Brexit-related issue is obviously talent, and you know, I know from my client work, I’m sure you’re the same Andrew, that you know, London attracts people from all around the world but also from Europe - and the financial services industry seems to be ahead of others - how is it reacting to the uncertainty about the flow of talent, where talent is going to come from?"
5,People planning,95,"Okay, well I think the first thing that clients are focussing on is data. So, that’s understanding who their people, who potentially are affected by Brexit, are. So, where their EU citizens sit in their organisation, where their UK citizens based in the European Union are located. What are the skills those individuals have, and how valuable those skills are to the organisation. And then look at other metrics around their population who are affected by Brexit. So, that’s the base case. That’s understanding what’s at risk: what areas do you need to be conscious of in terms of your people."
5,People planning,95,"Secondly, I think clients are really focussed on integrated planning, making sure that what they do from a people perspective is linked into their broader Brexit planning. There’s no point doing these things in isolation, and one has got to follow the other - people has got to be a subsidiary of the overall Brexit strategy for the organisation. And thirdly, I think operational considerations are really key at the moment, because we’re only a year-and-a-half or so away from March 2019; and if you’re planning back from that timeframe, and thinking about what changes you’re going to need to make in your organisation, there isn’t a lot of time to think about it. And whilst the political debate is ongoing, and clarity really isn’t there yet, organisations are increasingly no longer having the luxury of being able to wait around. So, really planning into your operational cycle, the changes that you are going to need to make."
5,People planning,95,"Absolutely, that is also key because organisations, particularly the kind of just-in-time market in which we operate at the moment, if one of your key suppliers within your supply chain is heavily dependent on EU citizens or on Brits in a certain part of the European Union, knowing that that dependency exists, and knowing that the organisation is doing something about it, I think, is equally important. So, really, integrated planning, and that is not just about your own organisation, but your broader supply chain network."
5,People planning,96,"So, Gaenor, I’ve been really lucky to be able to work with, you know, a really broad cross-section of clients in terms of looking at, you know, the people in the immigration and to Ben’s point, you know, I mean, data has been critically important. You know, a lot of clients, just did not even have the data, I mean, whilst they have done the right to work, checks, etc., it is about how they have recorded that. So, you know, a lot of clients have just been struggling to get that data on their systems, so they can start doing that sort of analysis."
5,People planning,96,"I think it is fair to say that there is probably different industry sectors, who have been more advanced in terms of that planning element. You know the FS sector is, you know, a prime example, you know. They have got critical, you know, regulatory requirements that they need to make. So, understanding their people perspective has been, you know, very crucial."
5,People planning,96,"For me, one of the first things that clients need to really think about is their communication, and how they communicate, and that communication piece actually will vary depending upon their EU workforce. So, for instance, I had one client, who had a very young EU workforce, who, you know, they were pretty agile in terms of their ability to come and go, and that is the attitude they took. But, I had another client, you know, where 80 percent of their board was actually EU nationals, and you know, they were key decision makers and being able to really understand and ensure how they were going to stay in the country was critically important. So, we have been working with a variety of clients on, one, different communication strategies, different opportunities to be able to also support their employees in a different way."
5,The tax factor,97,"Thank you Gaenor. I say that this budget was actually one where the ambition of the Chancellor was to try and keep everything stable and to try and demonstrate that it was a good, open environment for UK and for UK business. There were no major changes, especially in the Corporate Tax kind of world, again a key indicator for business that stability was the key. There were though indicators of where things might change in the future. Now clearly the Chancellor tried to make a change when it came to the National Insurance regime and whilst that has been unwound, it’s still an area that is ripe for reform and no doubt we will see changes coming in the future. I would say that the Chancellor this time round deliberately kept his cards close to his chest, just to wait and see how the landscape changes post the triggering of Article 50."
5,The tax factor,97,"Absolutely. First of all, let’s not forget that this is just the first budget of two that we’ll get this year so there is another budget coming in the autumn and that’s possibly why the Chancellor reigned back quite a lot on what he was going to do this time round, and in all respects that’s actually very sensible. Once we get the triggering of Article 50, we’ll then have a different landscape that we’re playing in, so I think it was right for the Chancellor to stand back and wait. We’ve also had pre-announcements that all the big things they’re considering so, for example, looking at the way we tax workers in the future, that will be subject to big consultations where all of the stakeholders will get to have a say so there’s lots more opportunities to do that but the industrial strategy could actually be key."
5,The tax factor,97,"It’s a really good question and it’s something that we’ve been looking at in quite some detail. I think as you saw from the changes that were announced on National Insurance, making even small changes can have big repercussions and that’s part of the problem in trying to get a Tax policy straight for the future as we’re going to see it. If you make small measures to try and achieve one part of the industrial strategy it could have a big knock-on impact somewhere else, so actually one of the things you could do is stand back and say well the whole system needs to be looked at again and in some respects this is a great time to do that, there’s a blank canvas, we know we’ve got a new future, we should be getting fit for the future, but actually it could also be the worst time to do that."
5,The road ahead,98,"The next thing that might trigger more information is, as Anna said, when the Prime Minister triggers Article 50 and there has to be a sort of communication with the 27, the Commission and the Parliament negotiators. Clearly that will be a pretty wide spread circulation of the British position which the EU have to agree how they’re responding to it, and I would have thought in that process it’s pretty likely that quite a lot of the elements of that exchange will get into the public domain through the media and other sources and therefore a bit more sight and a bit more sense of what the priorities are will become clearer. But I don’t think people should assume, given it is a negotiation, that just because there’s a way you know one side more clearly you can predict what the outcome is going to be, and negotiation which businesses understand only too well is exactly that, negotiate/agree/do the deal, and that’s going to take time and be difficult."
5,The road ahead,98,"Yes, I think if you … if businesses recognise that from the triggering of Article 50 there is a two year negotiation, in that two years we are still a member of the European Union, therefore we are still subject to the same rules and regulations and debates and agreements and arguments, but at the end of that process things will change, and therefore people have to start to think through what those changes will be at the end of that period, and the things that people have relied upon for over 40 years to run their business, as you and Anna rightly say Gaenor, in terms of how do we employ people, how do we bring in people from overseas at a high skilled end or a low skilled end, how do we run our supply chain, how do we get ready to sort of build things to export outside of Europe? All of those things will change and therefore the business model, the fundamental business model that an organisation has, will have to be looked at, and one has a window of two years, not only to look at it but start to make some of the fundamental changes that will be needed."
5,Mind the skills gap,99,"Well obviously business realises that in quite a short space of time their whole talent stream is going to change, so at the moment business has an enormous access to EU migration and obviously they are not going to have such a strong access in the future and therefore they have got to look very closely at the impact that this will have on their business and their supply chains."
5,Mind the skills gap,99,"Yes, so I mean I think that the businesses that are really going to face a very big impact are those that use low skilled EU migrants. So for example if you look at the construction industry, many of the construction companies use as much as 40-70% low skilled migration. One client I was talking to the other day thought that in five years’ time there might be a skills deficit of about 230,000 which is equivalent to the town of Luton, so they’re very concerned. If you look at the retail sector there’s three million people employed in the UK in the retail sector, initial prognosis is there is about 200,000 EU migrants, but in the actual distribution and warehousing behind that retail sector there are up to 70/80/90% low skilled migrants in some of those distribution warehousing facilities. Also the care sector is another sector."
5,Mind the skills gap,99,"Well obviously this is a big issue for business and I think the first thing to do is that business must practically work out what the impact is going to be on their business and also on their supply chain. One of the things that we are doing at PwC is, very shortly we are about to launch a report which will be the first of its kind that looks at really new data that’s never been looked at before to give a very good analysis of what’s going to happen from the migration perspective on London in particular."
5,Outlook for growth,100,"First of all, the consumer has kept spending because wages have been increasing faster than inflation. The worries about uncertainty affecting investment are not yet coming through but they may still come through, and the world economy has held up reasonably well. It’s also worth pointing out that the political situation, which looked very rocky after the referendum result, has actually stabilised. So it’s true that the UK economy has performed quite well in the last 6 months of 2016, but it’s still reasonable to expect slower growth in 2017 and 2018. So we’re expecting about 1.5% growth in those two years as inflation comes through and squeezes consumer spending. Investment uncertainty does have some impact on the growth of the economy."
5,Outlook for growth,100,"We’re certainly set for a period of higher inflation than we’ve had over the last 2-3 years. Inflation came down to zero in the UK and in a few months it was actually even slightly negative a year or two ago. It’s gradually been creeping up, it’s now nearly 2%, it’ll probably go over 2% in the next few months and it is probably going to stick around about 3% in the second half of this year and going into 2018. It’s not going to be as high as we saw in 2008 and 2011 when inflation went over 5%, but the period of relatively high inflation could be quite persistent. That’s because it takes a while for the fall in the value of the pound to feed through the pipeline of costs and to come through to consumers in the high street or in terms of on-line purchases."
5,Outlook for growth,100,"Yes. Wage inflation has been picking up but it’s not likely to compensate for that rise in inflation from about zero up to three. So wage inflation has been going at about 2-2.5%, it’s crept up slightly higher than 2.5% but the gap between inflation and wage growth is going to be quite significantly squeezed."
